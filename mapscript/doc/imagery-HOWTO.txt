Introduction
============

All examples in this document refer to the mapfile and testing layers
distributed with MapServer 4.2+ and found under mapserver/tests.

Pseudocode
----------

All examples will use a pseudocode that is consistent with the language
independent API reference.  Each line is a statement. For object attributes
and methods we use the dot, '.', operator.  Creation and deletion of objects
will be indicated by 'new' and 'del' keywords.  Other than that, the 
pseudocode looks a lot like Python.

Imagery Overview
================

The most common use of MapServer and mapscript is to create map imagery
using the built-in GD format drivers: GD/GIF, GD/PNG, GD/PNG24, and GD/JPEG.
This imagery might be saved to a file on disk or be streamed directly to
another device.

The imageObj Class
------------------

Imagery is represented in mapscript by the imageObj class.  Please see the
API Reference (mapscript.txt) for class attribute and method details.

Creating imageObj from a mapObj
-------------------------------

The mapObj class has two methods that return instances of imageObj: 'draw',
and 'prepareImage'.  The first returns a full-fledged map image just as one
would obtain from the mapserv CGI program::

    test_map = mapscript.mapObj('tests/test.map')
    map_image = test_map.draw()

A properly sized and formatted blank image, without any layers, symbols, or
labels, will be generated by 'prepareImage'::

    blank_image = test_map.prepareImage()

Creating a new imageObj
-----------------------

The imageObj class constructor creates new instances without need of a map::

    format = mapscript.outputFormatObj('GD/JPEG')
    image = mapscript.imageObj(300, 200, format)   # 300 wide, 200 high JPEG

and can even initialize from a file on disk::

    # First three args are overriden by attributes of the disk image file
    disk_image = mapscript.imageObj(-1, -1, NULL, 'tests/test.png')


Image Output
============

Creating files on disk
----------------------

Imagery is saved to disk by using the 'save' method.  By accessing the
'extension' attribute of an image's format, the proper file extension
can be used without making any assumptions::

    filename = 'test.' + map_image.format.extension
    map_image.save(filename)

If the image is using the GDAL/GTiff format, a GeoTIFF file can be created
on disk by adding a mapObj as a second optional argument to 'save'::

    map_image.save(filename, test_map)

Direct Output
-------------

An image can be dumped to an open filehandle using the 'write' method.  By
default, the filehandle is 'stdout'::

    # Send an image to a web browser
    print "Content-type: " + map_image.format.mimetype + "\n\n"
    map_image.write()

This method is not fully functional for all SWIG mapscript languages.  See the
API Reference (mapscript.txt) for details.  The 'write' method is new in 4.4.
    

Images and Symbols
==================

The symbolObj::getImage() method will return an instance of imageObj for
pixmap symbols::

    symbol = test_map.symbolset.getSymbolByName('home-png')
    image = symbol.getImage()

There is a symmetric 'setImage' method which loads imagery into a symbol,
allowing pixmap symbols to be created dynamically::

    new_symbol = mapscript.symbolObj('from_image')
    new_symbol.type = mapscript.MS_SYMBOL_PIXMAP
    new_symbol.setImage(image)
    index = test_map.symbolset.appendSymbol(new_symbol)

The get/setImage methods are new in MapServer 4.4.
