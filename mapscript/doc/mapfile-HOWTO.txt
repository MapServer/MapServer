Introduction
============

The mapscript HOWTO docs are intended to complement the API reference with
examples of usage for specific subjects.  All examples in this document refer
to the mapfile and testing layers distributed with MapServer 4.2+ and found
under mapserver/tests.  

Pseudocode
----------

All examples will use a pseudocode that is consistent with the language
independent API reference.  Each line is a statement. For object attributes
and methods we use the dot, '.', operator.  Creation and deletion of objects
will be indicated by 'new' and 'del' keywords.  Other than that, the 
pseudocode looks a lot like Python.

Mapfile Overview
================

By "Mapfile" here, I mean all the elements that can occur in (nearly)
arbitrary numbers within a mapscript mapObj: Layers, Classes, and Styles.
MapServer 4.4 has greatly improved capability to manipulate these objects.

The mapObj Class
================

An instance of mapObj is a parent for zero to many layerObj children.

New instances
-------------

The mapfile path argument to the mapscript.mapObj constructor is now optional
::

    empty_map = new mapscript.mapObj

generates a default mapObj with no layers.  A mapObj is initialized from a 
mapfile on disk in the usual manner::

    test_map = new mapscript.mapObj('tests/test.map')

Cloning
-------

An independent copy, less result and label caches, of a mapObj can be produced
by the new mapObj.clone() method::

    clone_map = test_map.clone()

.. note:: the Java mapscript module implements a "cloneMap" method to avoid
          conflict with the clone method of Java's Object class.

Saving
------

A mapObj can be saved to disk using the save method::

    clone_map.save('clone.map')

Frankly, the msSaveMap() function which is the foundation for mapObj::save
is incomplete.  Your mileage may vary.

Children of mapObj
==================

There is a common parent/child object API for Layers, Classes, and Styles in
MapServer 4.4.

Referencing a Child
-------------------

References to Layer, Class, and Style children are obtained by "getChild"-like
methods of their parent::

    layer_i   = test_map.getLayer(i)
    class_ij  =  layer_i.getClass(j)
    style_ijk = class_ij.getStyle(k)

These references are for convenience only.  Mapscript doesn't have any
reference counting, and you are certain to run into trouble if you try to use
these references after the parent mapObj has been deleted and freed from 
memory.

Cloning a Child
---------------

A completely independent Layer, Class, or Style can be created using the clone
method of layerObj, classObj, and styleObj::

    clone_layer = layer_i.clone()

This instance has no parent, and is self-owned.

New Children
------------

Uninitialized instances of layerObj, classObj, or styleObj can be created 
with the new constructors::

    new_layer = new mapscript.layerObj
    new_class = new mapscript.classObj
    new_style = new mapscript.styleObj

and are added to a parent object using "insertChild"-like methods of the
parent which returns the index at which the child was inserted::

    li = test_map.insertLayer(new_layer)
    ci = test_map.getLayer(li).insertClass(new_class)
    si = test_map.getLayer(li).getClass(ci).insertStyle(new_style)

The insert* methods create a completely new copy of the object and store it 
in the parent with all ownership taken on by the parent.

see the API reference for more details.  

Backwards Compatibility
-----------------------

The old style child object constructors with the parent object as a single
argument::

    new_layer = new mapscript.layerObj(test_map)
    new_class = new mapscript.classObj(new_layer)
    new_style = new mapscript.styleObj(new_class)

remain in MapServer 4.4.

Removing Children
-----------------

Child objects can be removed with "removeChild"-like methods of parents, which
return independent copies of the removed object::

    # following from the insertion example ...
    # remove the inserted style, returns a copy of the original new_style
    removed_style = test_map.getLayer(li).getClass(ci).removeStyle(si)
    removed_class = test_map.getLayer(li).removeClass(ci)
    removed_layer = test_map.removeLayer(li)

Metadata
========

Map, Layer, and Class metadata are the other arbitrarily numbered elements
(well, up to the built-in limit of 41) of a mapfile.

New API
-------

In MapServer 4.4, the metadata attributes of mapObj.web, layerObj, and classObj
are instances of hashTableObj, a class which functions like a limited 
dictionary
::

    layer.metadata.set('wms_name', 'foo')
    name = layer.metadata.get('wms_name')   # returns 'foo'

You can iterate over all keys in a hashTableObj like
::
    
    key = NULL
    while (1):
        key = layer.metadata.nextKey(key)
        if key == NULL:
            break
        value = layer.metadata.get(key)
        ...

See the API Reference (mapscript.txt) for more details.

Old API
-------

The old getMetaData and setMetaData methods of mapObj, layerObj, and classObj
remain for use by older programs.
