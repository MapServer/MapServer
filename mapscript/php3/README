                    PHP/MapScript Mapserver Module
                    ==============================

$Id$
                      --------------------------

This is a PHP module to make MapServer's MapScript functionalities 
available in a PHP Dynamically Loadable Library.  

PHP MapScript was originally developed for PHP-3.0.14 but after MapServer
3.5 support for PHP3 has been dropped and as of the last update of this
document, PHP 4.1.2 or more recent was required.

The module has been tested and used on Linux, Solaris, *BSD, and WinNT.

There are documentation and examples for PHP MapScript available via
the MapServer documentation webpage at:
  http://mapserver.gis.umn.edu/doc.html

See also the MapServer Wiki for links to more informations on this module:
  http://mapserver.gis.umn.edu/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?PHPMapScript

                      --------------------------

Currently supported classes, properties and methods:
====================================================

  Very important notes:
  ---------------------

  - Constant names and class member variable names are case-sensitive in PHP.

  - Several MapScript functions (all those that access files in the back end
    such as ms_newMapObj(), drawMap(), etc) will affect the value of the 
    current working directory (CWD) in the PHP environment. This will be 
    fixed eventually but in the meantime you should be careful about these 
    side-effects.

 Functions:
 ----------

   string ms_GetVersion()
        Returns the MapServer version and options in a string.  This string
        can be parsed to find out which modules were compiled in, etc.

   array ms_TokenizeMap(string map_file_name)
        Preparses a mapfile through the MapServer parser and return an 
        array with one item for each token from the mapfile.  Strings, 
        logical expressions, regex expressions and comments are returned
        as individual tokens.

   void ms_ioinstallstdouttobuffer()
       Installs a mapserver IO handler directing future stdout output 
       to a memory buffer. 

   void ms_ioinstallstdinfrombuffer()
      Installs a mapserver IO handler directing future stdin reading 
      (ie. post request capture) to come from a buffer. 

   void ms_iogetstdoutbufferstring()
      Fetch the current stdout buffer contents as a string.  This method 
      does not clear the buffer.

    int ms_iogetStdoutBufferBytes() 
       Writes the current buffer to stdout.  The PHP header() function should be 
       used to set the documents's content-type prior to calling the function.
       Returns the number of bytes written if output is sent to stdout.  
       See http://mapserver.gis.umn.edu/docs/howto/wxs_mapscript/view for
       more info.

   void ms_ioresethandlers()   
     Resets the default stdin and stdout handlers in place of "buffer" based
     handlers. 
     
   void ms_iostripstdoutbuffercontenttype()
     Strip the Content-type header off the stdout buffer if it has one, and
     if a content type is found it is return. Otherwise return false.

 MapObj Class:
 -------------

 Constructor:

   mapObj ms_newMapObj(string map_file_name [, string new_map_path])
        Returns a new object to deal with a MapServer map file.

        By default, the SYMBOLSET, FONTSET, and other paths in the mapfile
        are relative to the mapfile location.  If new_map_path is provided
        then this directory will be used as the base path for all the 
        relative paths inside the mapfile.

 Methods:

   mapObj clone()
        Returns a handle to a new mapObj which is a clone of the current
        mapObj.  All parameters in the current mapObj are copied to the
        new mapObj.  Returns NULL (0) on error.

   int set(string property_name, new_value)
        Set map object property to new value. Returns -1 on error.

   int getsymbolbyname(string symbol_name)  
        Returns the symbol index using the name.

   symbol getsymbolobjectbyid(int symbolid)
        Returns the symbol object using a symbol id. Refer to
        the symbol object reference section for more details.

   void preparequery()
        Calculate the scale of the map and assign it to the map->scale.
             
   imageObj prepareImage()
        Return handle on blank image object.

   imageObj draw()
        Render map and return handle on image object.

   imageObj drawQuery()
        Render a query map and return handle on image object.

   imageObj drawLegend()
        Render legend and return handle on image object.

   imageObj drawReferenceMap()
        Render reference map and return handle on image object.

   imageObj drawScaleBar()
        Render scale bar and return handle on image object.

   int embedlegend(imageObj image) 
        embeds a legend. Actually the legend is just added to the label 
        cache so you must invoke drawLabelCache() to actually do the 
        rendering (unless postlabelcache is set in which case it is 
        drawn right away).

   int embedScalebar(imageObj image) 
        embeds a scalebar. Actually the scalebar is just added to the label 
        cache so you must invoke drawLabelCache() to actually do the rendering 
        (unless postlabelcache is set in which case it is drawn right away).

   int drawLabelCache(imageObj image)
        Renders the labels for a map. Returns -1 on error.

   layerObj getLayer(int index)
        Returns a layerObj from the map given an index value (0=first layer)

   layerObj getLayerByName(string layer_name)
        Returns a layerObj from the map given a layer name.  
        Returns FALSE if layer doesn't exist.

   colorObj getcolorbyindex(int iCloIndex)
    Returns a colorObj corresponding to the color index in the palette

   void setExtent(double minx, double miny, double maxx, double maxy)
    Set the map extents using the georef extents passed in argument.

   int setRotation(double rotation_angle)
        Set map rotation angle. The map view rectangle (specified in 
        EXTENTS) will be rotated by the indicated angle in the counter-
        clockwise direction. Note that this implies the rendered map 
        will be rotated by the angle in the clockwise direction.
        Returns MS_SUCCESS or MS_FAILURE.

   int setSize(int width, int height)
        Set the map width and height. This method updates the internal
        geotransform and other data structures required for map rotation
        so it should be used instead of setting the width and height members
        directly.
        Returns MS_SUCCESS or MS_FAILURE.

   int queryByPoint(pointObj point, int mode, double buffer)
        Query all selected layers in map at point location specified in 
        georeferenced map coordinates (i.e. not pixels).  
        The query is performed on all the shapes that are part of a CLASS 
        that contains a TEMPLATE value or that match any class in a
        layer that contains a LAYER TEMPLATE value.
        Mode is MS_SINGLE or MS_MULTIPLE depending on number of results
        you want. 
        Passing buffer <=0 defaults to tolerances set in the map file 
        (in pixels) but you can use a constant buffer (specified in 
        ground units) instead.
        Returns MS_SUCCESS if shapes were found or MS_FAILURE if nothing
        was found or if some other error happened (note that the error 
        message in case nothing was found can be avoided in PHP using 
        the '@' control operator).

   int queryByRect(rectObj rect)
        Query all selected layers in map using a rectangle specified in 
        georeferenced map coordinates (i.e. not pixels).
        The query is performed on all the shapes that are part of a CLASS 
        that contains a TEMPLATE value or that match any class in a
        layer that contains a LAYER TEMPLATE value.
        Returns MS_SUCCESS if shapes were found or MS_FAILURE if nothing
        was found or if some other error happened (note that the error 
        message in case nothing was found can be avoided in PHP using 
        the '@' control operator).

   int queryByShape(shapeObj shape)
        Query all selected layers in map based on a single shape, the 
        shape has to be a polygon at this point.
        Returns MS_SUCCESS if shapes were found or MS_FAILURE if nothing
        was found or if some other error happened (note that the error 
        message in case nothing was found can be avoided in PHP using 
        the '@' control operator).

   int queryByFeatures(int slayer) 
        Perform a query based on a previous set of results from
        a layer. At present the results MUST be based on a polygon layer.
        Returns MS_SUCCESS if shapes were found or MS_FAILURE if nothing
        was found or if some other error happened (note that the error 
        message in case nothing was found can be avoided in PHP using 
        the '@' control operator).

   int queryByIndex(layerindex, tileindex, shapeindex, addtoquery)
        Add a specific shape on a given layer to the query result.
        If addtoquery (which is a non mandatory argument) is set to MS_TRUE,
        the shape will be added to the existing query list. Default behavaior
        is to free the existing query list and add only the new shape.

   int savequery(filename)
        Save the current query in a file. Returns MS_SUCESS or MS_FAILURE.
        Can be used with loadquery

   int loadquery(filename)
        Loads a query from a file. Returns MS_SUCESS or MS_FAILURE.
        To be used with savequery.

   void freequery(layerindex)
        Frees the query result on a specified layer. If the layerindex is -1,
        all queries on layers will be freed.

   int save(string filename)
        Save current map object state to a file. Returns -1 on error.
        Use absolute path. If a relative path is used, then it will be 
        relative to the mapfile location.

   string getProjection()
        Returns a string represenation of the projection. If no 
        projection is set, MS_FALSE is returned.

   int setProjection(string proj_params, boolean bSetUnitsAndExtents)
        Set map projection and coordinate system.  Parameters are given as 
        a single string of comma-delimited PROJ.4 parameters.
        The argument : bSetUnitsAndExtents is used to automatically update
        the map units and extents based on the new projection. Possible 
        values are MS_TRUE and MS_FALSE. By defualt it is set at MS_FALSE

   int setWKTProjection(string proj_params, boolean bSetUnitsAndExtents)
        Same as setProjection(), but takes an OGC WKT projection 
        definition string as input.

   int getMetaData(string name)
        Fetch metadata entry by name (stored in the WEB object in the map
        file).  Returns "" if no entry matches the name.  Note that the
        search is case sensitive.

   int setMetaData(string name, string value)
        Set a metadata entry for the map (stored in the WEB object in the map
        file).  Returns MS_SUCCESS/MS_FAILURE.

   int removeMetaData(string name)
        Remove a metadata entry for the map (stored in the WEB object in the map
        file).  Returns MS_SUCCESS/MS_FAILURE.

   array getLayersIndexByGroup(string groupname)
        Return an array containing all the layer's indexes given
        a group name.

   array getAllGroupNames()
        Return an array containing all the group names used in the
        layers.  

   array getAllLayerNames()
        Return an array containing all the layer names.

   boolean moveLayerUp(int layerindex)
        Move layer up in the hierarcy of drawing.

   array   getlayersdrawingorder()
        Return an array containing layer's index in the order which they
        are drawn.

   boolean  setlayersdrawingorder(array layeryindex)
        Set the layer's order array. The argument passed must be a valid
        array with all the layer's index. 
        Return TRUE on success or else FALSE.

   string processtemplate(array params, boolean generateimages)
        Process the template file specified in the web object and return 
        the resut in a buffer. 
        The processing consists of opening the template file and replace
        all the tags found in it.
        Only tags that have an equivalent element in the map object are
        replaced (ex [scale]). 
        The are two expetions to the previous statement :
          - [img], [scalebar], [ref], [legend] would be replaced with the 
            appropriate url if the parameter generateimages is set to 
            MS_TRUE. (Note :  the images corresponding to the diffrent objects 
            are generated if the object is set to MS_ON in the map file)
         - the user can use the params parameter to specify tags and 
           their values. For example if the user have a specific tag call
           [my_tag] and would like it to be replaced by "value_of_my_tag"
           he would do :
              $tmparray["my_tag"] = "value_of_my_tag";
              $map->processtemplate($tmparray, MS_FALSE);
         
   string processquerytemplate(array params, boolean generateimages)     
       Process query template files and return the resut in a buffer.
       Second argument generateimages is not manadatory. If not given
        It will be set to TRUE.

       See also : processtemplate function.
   
   string processlegendtemplate(array params)     
       Process legend template files and return the resut in a buffer.

     See also : processtemplate function.

   int setSymbolSet(string fileName)
       Load and set a symbol file dynamictly.
       
   int getNumSymbols()
       Return the number of symbols in map.
       
   int setFontSet(string fileName)
       Load and set a new fontset.
       

   int selectOutputFormat(string type)
        Selects the output format to be used in the map. 
        Returns MS_SUCCESS/MS_FAILURE.
       
        Note : the type used should correspond to one of the output
               formats declared in the map file.
               The type argument passed is compared with the mimetype
               parameter in the output format structure and then to
               the name parameter in the structure. 

   int saveMapContext(string filename)
        Available only if WMS support is enabled.
        Save current map object state in WMS Map Context format. 
        Only WMS layers are saved in the WMS Map Context XML file.
        Returns MS_SUCCESS/MS_FAILURE.

   int loadMapContext(string filename [, boolean unique_layer_name])
        Available only if WMS support is enabled.
        Load a WMS Map Context XML file into the current mapObj.
        If the map already contains some layers then the layers defined
        in the WMS Map context document are added to the current map.
        The 2nd argument unique_layer_name is optional and if set to 
        MS_TRUE layers created will have a unique name (unique prefix
        added to the name). If set to MS_FALSE the layer name will be the 
        the same name as in the context. The default value is MS_FALSE.
        Returns MS_SUCCESS/MS_FAILURE.


  int applySLD(string sldxml)
        Apply the SLD document to the map file. The matching between the
        sld document and the map file will be done using the layer's name.
        See SLD How to for more information on the SLD support.

  int applySLDURL(string sldurl)
        Apply the SLD document pointed by the URL to the map file. The 
        matching between the sld document and the map file will be done 
        using the layer's name.
        See SLD How to for more information on the SLD support.

  string generateSLD()
        Returns an SLD XML string based on all the classes found in all 
        the layers.

  string getconfigoption(string key)
        Returns the config value associated with the key.
        Returns an empty sting if key not found.

  int  setconfigoption(string key, string value)
        Sets a config parameter using the key and the value passed

  int applyconfigoptions()
        Applies the config options set in the map file. For example
        seeting the PROJ_LIB using the setconfigoption only modifies
        the value in the map object. applyconfigoptions will actually
        change the PROJ_LIB  value that will be used when dealing with
        projection.


  int loadowsparameters(owsrequest request, string version)
        Load OWS request parameters (BBOX, LAYERS, &c.) into map.  Returns
    MS_SUCCESS or MS_FAILURE.   
        2nd argument version is not mandatory. If not given, the version
       will be set to 1.1.1
    
  int owsdispatch(owsrequest request)
    Processes and executes the passed OpenGIS Web Services request on the 
    map.  Returns MS_DONE (2) if there is no valid OWS request in the req 
    object, MS_SUCCESS (0) if an OWS request was successfully processed and
    MS_FAILURE (1) if an OWS request was not successfully processed.  OWS
    requests include WMS, WFS, WCS and SOS requests supported by MapServer. 
    Results of a dispatched request are written to stdout and can be captured
    using the msIO services (ie. ms_ioinstallstdouttobuffer() and 
    ms_iogetstdoutbufferstring())


 LayerObj Class:
 ---------------

 Constructor:
   Layer Objects can be returned by the MapObj class, or can be created
   using:

   layerObj ms_newLayerObj(MapObj map [, layerObj layer])

   A second optional argument can be given to ms_newLayerObj() to create
   the new layer as a copy of an existing layer. If a layer is given as

        Set object property to a new value. Returns -1 on error.

   int draw(imageObj image)
        Draw a single layer, add labels to cache if required. 
        Returns -1 on error.

   int drawQuery(imageObj image)
        Draw query map for a single layer.

   classObj getClass(int classIndex)
        Returns a classObj from the layer given an index value (0=first class)

   int queryByPoint(pointObj point, int mode, double buffer)
        Query layer at point location specified in georeferenced map 
        coordinates (i.e. not pixels).  
        The query is performed on all the shapes that are part of a CLASS 
        that contains a TEMPLATE value or that match any class in a
        layer that contains a LAYER TEMPLATE value.
        Mode is MS_SINGLE or MS_MULTIPLE depending on number of results
        you want. 
        Passing buffer <=0 defaults to tolerances set in the map file 
        (in pixels) but you can use a constant buffer (specified in 
        ground units) instead.
        Returns MS_SUCCESS if shapes were found or MS_FAILURE if nothing
        was found or if some other error happened (note that the error 
        message in case nothing was found can be avoided in PHP using 
        the '@' control operator).

   int queryByRect(rectObj rect)
        Query layer using a rectangle specified in georeferenced map 
        coordinates (i.e. not pixels).
        The query is performed on all the shapes that are part of a CLASS 
        that contains a TEMPLATE value or that match any class in a
        layer that contains a LAYER TEMPLATE value.
        Returns MS_SUCCESS if shapes were found or MS_FAILURE if nothing
        was found or if some other error happened (note that the error 
        message in case nothing was found can be avoided in PHP using 
        the '@' control operator).

   int queryByShape(shapeObj shape)
        Query layer based on a single shape, the shape has to be a polygon
        at this point.
        Returns MS_SUCCESS if shapes were found or MS_FAILURE if nothing
        was found or if some other error happened (note that the error 
        message in case nothing was found can be avoided in PHP using 
        the '@' control operator).

   int queryByFeatures(int slayer) 
        Perform a query set based on a previous set of results from
        another layer. At present the results MUST be based on a polygon
        layer.
        Returns MS_SUCCESS if shapes were found or MS_FAILURE if nothing
        was found or if some other error happened (note that the error 
        message in case nothing was found can be avoided in PHP using 
        the '@' control operator).

   int queryByAttributes(string qitem, string qstring, int mode)
        Query layer for shapes that intersect current map extents.
        qitem is the item (attribute) on which the query is performed, 
        and qstring is the expression to match.
        The query is performed on all the shapes that are part of a CLASS 
        that contains a TEMPLATE value or that match any class in a
        layer that contains a LAYER TEMPLATE value.  
        Note that the layer's FILTER/FILTERITEM are ignored by this function.
        Mode is MS_SINGLE or MS_MULTIPLE depending on number of results
        you want. 
        Returns MS_SUCCESS if shapes were found or MS_FAILURE if nothing
        was found or if some other error happened (note that the error 
        message in case nothing was found can be avoided in PHP using 
        the '@' control operator).

   int setFilter(string expression)
        Set layer filter expression.

   string getFilter()
        Returns the expression for this layer.

   string getProjection()
        Returns a string represenation of the projection. If no 
        projection is set, MS_FALSE is returned.

   int setProjection(string proj_params)
        Set layer projection and coordinate system.  Parameters are given as 
        a single string of comma-delimited PROJ.4 parameters.

   int setWKTProjection(string proj_params)
        Same as setProjection(), but takes an OGC WKT projection 
        definition string as input.

   int getNumResults()
        Returns the number of results from this layer in the last query.

   resultCacheMemberObj getResult(int index)
        Returns a resultCacheMemberObj by index from a layer object with 
        index in the range 0 to numresults-1.  
        Returns a valid object or FALSE(0) if index is invalid.

   int open()
        Open the layer for use with getShape().  
        Returns MS_SUCCESS/MS_FAILURE.

   int whichshapes(rectobj)
        Performs a spatial, and optionally an attribute based feature search. 
        The function basically prepares things so that candidate features can be 
        accessed by query or drawing functions (eg using nextshape function).
        Returns MS_SUCCESS or MS_FAILURE.

   shpeobj nextShape()
       Called after msWhichShapes has been called to actually retrieve shapes 
       within a given area           
       returns a shape object or MS_FALSE


        example of usage :

        $map = ms_newmapobj("d:/msapps/gmap-ms40/htdocs/gmap75.map");
        $layer = $map->getLayerByName('road');
        $status = $layer->open();
        $status = $layer->whichShapes($map->extent);
        while ($shape = $layer->nextShape()) 
        {
           echo $shape->index ."<br>\n";
        }
        $layer->close();




   void close()
        Close layer previously opened with open().

   shapeObj getShape(int tileindex, int shapeindex)
        Retrieve shapeObj from a layer by index.
        Tileindex is used only for tiled shapefiles (you get it from the
        resultCacheMemberObj returned by getResult() for instance).
        Simply pass tileindex = -1 for other data sources.

   rectObj getExtent()
        Returns the layer's data extents. 
        If the layer's EXTENT member is set then this value is used, 
        otherwise this call opens/closes the layer to read the 
        extents. This is quick on shapefiles, but can be
        an expensive operation on some file formats or data sources.
        This function is safe to use on both opened or closed layers: it
        is not necessary to call open()/close() before/after calling it.

   int addFeature(shapeObj shape)
        Add a new feature in a layer.  Returns -1 on error.

   int getMetaData(string name)
        Fetch layer metadata entry by name.  Returns "" if no entry 
        matches the name.  Note that the search is case sensitive.

   int setMetaData(string name, string value)
        Set a metadata entry for the layer.  Returns MS_SUCCESS/MS_FAILURE.

   int removeMetaData(string name)
        Remove a metadata entry for the layer.  Returns MS_SUCCESS/MS_FAILURE.

   string getWMSFeatureInfoURL(int clickX, int clickY, int featureCount, 
                               string infoFormat)
        Return a WMS GetFeatureInfo URL (works only for WMS layers)
        clickX, clickY is the location of to query in pixel coordinates
        with (0,0) at the top left of the image.
        featureCount is the number of results to return.
        infoFormat is the format the format in which the result should be
        requested.  Depends on remote server's capabilities.  MapServer
        WMS servers support only "MIME" (and should support "GML.1" soon).
        Returns "" and outputs a warning if layer is not a WMS layer 
        or if it is not queriable.
        
   aString getItems()
        return a list of items. Must call open function first.

   boolean setProcessing(string)
        Add the string to the processing string list for the layer.
        The layer->num_processing is incremented by 1.
        Ex : $oLayer->setprocessing("SCALE_1=AUTO");
             $oLayer->setprocessing("SCALE_2=AUTO");       

   aString getProcessing()
        Returns an array containing the processing strings

   boolean clearProcessing()
        Clears all the processing strings

   string   executeWFSGetfeature()
       Executes a GetFeature request on a WFS layer and returns the
       name of the temporary GML file created. Returns an empty
       string on error.

   int applySLD(string sldxml, string namedlayer)
        Apply the SLD document to the layer object. 
        The matching between the sld document and the layer will be done 
        using the layer's name.
        If a namedlayer argument is passed (argument is optional), 
        the NamedLayer in the sld that matchs it will be used to style 
        the layer.
        See SLD How to for more information on the SLD support.

  int applySLDURL(string sldurl, string namedlayer)
        Apply the SLD document pointed by the URL to the layer object. The 
        matching between the sld document and the layer will be done using 
        the layer's name.
        If a namedlayer argument is passed (argument is optional), 
        the NamedLayer in the sld that matchs it will be used to style 
        the layer.
        See SLD How to for more information on the SLD support.

  string generateSLD()
        Returns an SLD XML string based on all the classes found in the layers.

  int moveclassup(int index)
        The class specified by the class index will be moved up into
        the array of layers. Returns MS_SUCCESS or MS_FAILURE.
        ex layer->moveclassup(1) will have the effect of moving class 1
           up to postion 0, and the class at position 0 will be moved
           to position 1.

  int moveclassdown(int index)
        The class specified by the class index will be moved down into
        the array of layers. Returns MS_SUCCESS or MS_FAILURE.
        ex layer->moveclassdown(0) will have the effect of moving class 0
           up to postion 1, and the class at position 1 will be moved
           to position 0.

  classObj removeClass(int index)
        Removes the class indicated and returns a copy, or NULL in the case
        of a failure.  Note that subsequent classes will be renumbered by
        this operation. The numclasses field contains the number of classes
        available.

  boolean isVisible()
       Returns MS_TRUE/MS_FALSE depending on whether the layer is 
       currently visible in the map (i.e. turned on, in scale, etc.).

 Methods:

   void free()
        Destroys resources used by an image object.

   int saveImage(string filename, MapObj oMap)
        Writes image object to specifed filename.
        Passing an empty filename sends output to stdout.  In this case,
        the PHP header() function should be used to set the documents's
        content-type prior to calling saveImage().
        The output format is the one that is currently selected in the 
        map file.
        The second argument oMap is not manadatory. It is usful when 
        saving to formats like GTIFF that needs georeference informations
        contained in the map file.
        The function returns -1 on error.  On success, it returns either 0
        if writing to an external file, or the number of bytes written if 
        output is sent to stdout.

   string saveWebImage()
        Writes image to temp directory.  Returns image URL.
        The output format is the one that is currently selected in the 
        map file.
       

   void pasteImage(imageObj srcImg, int transparentColorHex 
                   [[, int dstX, int dstY], int angle])
        Copy srcImg on top of the current imageObj.
        transparentColorHex is the color (in 0xrrggbb format) from srcImg 
        that should be considered transparent (i.e. those pixels won't 
        be copied).  Pass -1 if you don't want any transparent color.
        If optional dstx,dsty are provided then it defines the position 
        where the image should be copied (dstx,dsty = top-left corner 
        position).
        The optional angle is a value between 0 and 360 degrees to rotate
        the source image counterclockwise.  Note that if an angle is specified
        (even if its value is zero) then the dstx and dsty coordinates 
        specify the CENTER of the destination area.
        Note: this function works only with 8 bits GD images (PNG or GIF).
