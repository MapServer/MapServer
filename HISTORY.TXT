  thick lines and patterns (i.e. dashes)aren't supported.
  this is triggered when the symbol is of TYPE SYMBOL *and* its ANTIALIAS
  is off (wating to find a better solution to trigger this).

- AGG: the pixmap of pixmap symbols is now cached in an agg-compatible state
  the first time it is accessed. this avoids rereading and retransforming 
  it each time that symbol is used.

- AGG: the imageObj now stores in what state it's alpha channel is in. The 
  number ofmsAlphaGD2AGG/AGG2GD calls is now reduced, but most importantly
  each of these calls is usually just a check for this state and does 
  no computation.

  testing whether or not _WIN32 is defined for the usage of posix threads
  because unix is not defined on compilers like GCC 4.0.1 for OS X.

- Fixed the fuzzy brush support so that the transition between 1 pixel aa lines 
  and brushes is less obvious. The old code would not allow for a 3x3 fuzzy 
  brush to be built. (bug 1659)

- Added missing mapscript function msConnPoolCloseUnreferenced() (bug 1661)
  We need to make conn. pooling handling transparent to mapscript users
  so that they do not have to call this function once in a while, for instance
  by creating an evictor thread.

- Added calls to msSetup/msCleanup() at MapScript load/unload time (bug 1665)

- Reorganized nmake.opt to be more focused on functionality groups rather 
  than the propensity of a section to be edited.  Default values are now 
  all set to be pointed at the MapServer Build Kit, which can be obtained 
  at http://hobu.stat.iastate.edu/mapserver/

- configure.in/Makefile.in: Use PROJ_LIBS instead of PROJ_LIB.  PROJ_LIB
  is sometimes defined in the environment, but points to $prefix/share/proj
  not the proj link libraries.  

- Update Web Map Context to 1.1.0, add the dimension support. (bug 1581)

  prevent problems with more than 128 classes (bug 1633)

- WMS : SLD / stretch images when using FE (Bug 1627)

- Add gml:lineStringMember in GML2 MultiLineString geometry (bug 1569).

- PHP : add shape->sontainsshape that uses geos lib (Bug 1623).

- Move gBYTE_ORDER inside the pg layerinfo structure to allow for differently
  byte ordered connections (bug 1587).

- Fix the memory allocation bug in sdeShapeCopy (Bug 1606)

- Fixed OGR WKT support (Bug 1614). 

- Added shapeObj::toWkt() and ms_shapeObjFromWkt() to PHP MapScript (bug 1466)

- Detect/add -DHAVE_VSNPRINTF in configure script and prevent systematic
  buffer overflow in imagemap code when vsnprintf() not available (bug 1613)

- Default layer->project to MS_TRUE even if no projection is set, to allow
  geotransforms (nonsquare pixels, etc) to be applied (bug 1645).

- Force stdin into binary mode on win32 when reading post bodies. (bug 1768)

- Correct bound reprojection issue with ogc filer (Bug 1600)

- Correct mapscript windows build problem when flag USE_WMS_SVR was
  not set (Bug 1529)   

- Fix up allocation of the SDE ROW_ID columns and how the functions that
  call it were using it. (bug 1605)

- Fixed crash with 3D polygons in Oracle Spatial (bug 1593)


Version 4.8.0-rc1 (2005-12-22)

- PostGIS layer test cases and fix for broken views and sub-selects (bug 1443).

- SDE: Removed (commented out) support for SDE rasters at this time.  As far 
  as I know, I'm the only one to ever get it to work, it hasn't kept up with 
  the connection pooling stuff we did, and its utility is quite limited in 
  comparison to regular gdal-based raster support (projections, 
  resampling, etc) (HB - bug 1560).

- SDE: Put msSDELayerGetRowIDColumn at the top of mapsde.c so things 
  would compile correctly.  This function is not included (or necessary) 
  in the rest of the MS RFC 3 layer virtualization at this time.
  
- WFS : TYPENAME is manadatory for GetFeature request (Bug 1554).

- SLD : error parsing font parameters with the keyword "normal" (Bug 1552)

- Correct php/mapscript bug : initialization of scale happens when
  preparequery is called (Bug 1334).

- msProjectShape() will now project the lines it can, but completely
  delete lines that cannot be projected properly and "NULL" the shape if
  there are no lines left. (Bug 411)

- Expose msLayerWhichShapes and msLayerNextShape in MapScript. (bug 1481) 

- Added support to MapScript to change images in a previously defined
  symbol. (bug 1471)

- Fixed --enable-point-z-m fix in configure.in (== -> =) (bug 1485).

- Extra scalebar layer creation is prevented with a typo fix in mapscale.c. 
  Good catch, Tamas (bug 1480).
  
- mapwmslayer.c : use transparency set at the layer level on wms client 
                  layers  (Bug 1458) 

- mapresample.c: added BILINEAR/AVERAGE resampling options. 

- mapfile.c: avoid tail recursion in freeFeatureList().

- maplegend.c: fixed leak of imageObj when embedding legends.

- msGDALCleanup(): better error handler cleanup.

- Modified msResetErrorList() to free the last error link too, to ensure

  PropertyIsEqual and PropertyIsLike  (bug 1416)

- Fixed sortshp.c to free shapes after processing to avoid major
  memory leak. (bug 1418)

- fixed msHTTPInit() not ever being called which prevented msHTTPCleanup()
  from properly cleaning up cUrl with curl_global_cleanup(). (bug 1417)
  
- mapsde.c: add thread locking in msSDELCacheAdd

- Bug 1149: From WMS 1.1.1, SRS are given in individual tags in root Layer
  element.

- First pass at properly handling XML exceptions from CONNECTIONTYPE WMS
  layers. Still needs some work. (bug 1246)

- map.h/mapdraw.c: removed MAX/MIN macros in favour of MS_MAX/MS_MIN.

- Bug 1341, 1342 : Parse the unit parameter for DWithin filter request.
  Set the layer tolerance and toleranceunit with paramaters parsed.

- Bug 1277 : Support of multiple logical operators in Filter Encoding.

  is posted as a WCS exception.

- Added experimental support for "labelcache_map_edge_buffer" metadata to
  define a buffer area with no labels around the edge of a map (bug 1353)


Version 4.6.0-beta2 (2005-05-11)
--------------------------------

- Bug 179 :  add a small buffer around the cliping rectangle to
  avoid lines around the edges.

- Finished code to convert back and forth between GEOS geometries. Buffer and
  convex hull operations are exposed in mapscript.

- fontset.fonts hash now exposed in mapscript (bug 1345).

- Bug 1336 : Retreive distance value for DWithin filter request 
  done with line and polygon shapes/

- Bug 985 / 1015: Don't render raster layers as classified if none of
  the classes has an expression set (gdal renderer only). 

- Bug 1344: Fixed several issues in writing of inline SYMBOLS when saving
  mapfile (missing quotes around CHARACTER and other string members of SYMBOL
  object, check for NULLs, and write correct identifiers for POSITION, 
  LINECAP and LINEJOIN).

--------------------------------

- Bug 1305: Added support for gradient coloring in class styles

- Bug 1335 : missing call to msInitShape in function msQueryByShape

- Bug 804 : SWF output : Make sure that the layer index is consistent 
  when saving movies if some of the layers are not drawn (because the
  status is off or out of scale ...)

- Bug 1332 - shptreevis.c: fixed setting of this_rec, as the output dbf
  file was not getting any records at all.

- Fixed Makefile.vc to make .exe files depend on the DLL, so if the DLL
  fails to build, things will stop.  Avoids the need for unnecessary
  cleans on win32.  Also fixed the rule for MS_VERSION for mapscriptvars.

- Bug 1262 : the SERVICE parameter is now required for wms and wfs 
  GetCapbilities request. It is not required for other WMS requests.
  It is required for all WFS requests.

- Bug 1302 : the wfs/ows_service parameter is not used any more. The
  service is always set to WFS for WFS layers.

- Bug 791: initialize some fields in msDBFCreate() - avoids crashes in
  some circumstances.

- Bug 1329 : Apply sld named layer on all layers of the same group

- Bug 1328 : support style's width parameter for line and polygon layers.

- Bug 564: Fixed old problem with labels occasionally drawn upside down

- Bug 1325: php mapscript function $class->settext needs only 1 argument.

- Bug 1319: Fixed mutex creation (was creator-owned) in mapthread.c. win32
  issue only.

- Bug 1103: Set the default tolerance value based on the layer type.
  The default is now 3 for point and line layers and 0 for all the others.

- Bug 1244: Removing Z and M parameter from pointObj by default. A new 
  compilation option is available to active those option --enable-point-z-m.
  This gives an overall performance gain around 7 to 10%.

- Bug 1225: MapServer now requires GD 2.0.16 or more recent

- MapScript: shapeObj allocates memory for 4 value strings, shapeObj.setValue()
  lets users set values of a shapeObj.
  
- MapScript: imageObj.getBytes() replaces imageObj.write() (bugs 1176, 1064).

- Bug 1308: Correction of SQL expression generated on wfs filters for
  postgis/oracle layers.

- Bug 1304: Avoid extra white space in gml:coordinates for gml:Box.

- mapogr.c: Insure that tile index reading is restarted in 
  msOGRLayerInitItemInfo() or else fastcgi repeat requests for a layer may 
  fail on subsequent renders.

- mapogr.c: Set a real OGRPolygon spatial filter, not just an OGRLinearRing.
            Otherwise GEOS enabled OGR builds will do expensive, and 
            incorrect Intersects() tests.

- mapogr.cpp / mapprimitive.c: Optimize msAddLine() and add msAddLineDirectly()

- mapprimitive.c: Optimizations in msTransformShapeToPixel() (avoid division)

- Bug 1273: Fixed case in msProjectPoint() were in or out are NULL and
  a failure occurs to return NULL.  Fixed problem of WMS capabilities with
  'inf' in it.

  we have a modern PROJ.4.

- Bug 839: Fix memory leak of font name in label cache (in mapfile.c). 

- Added msForceTmpFileBase() and mapserv -tmpbase switch to allow overriding
  temporary file naming conventions.  Mainly intended to make writing 
  testscripts using mapserv easier. FrankW. 

- maporaclespatil.c: Bug fix for: #1109, #1110, #1111, #1112, #1136, #1210,
  #1211, #1212, #1213.  Support for compound polygons, fixed internal sql to
  stay more accurate for geodetic data, added the support for getextent
  function.  Added VERSION token for layer data string.

- mapimagemap.c: Preliminary implementation of support for emitting 
  MS_SYMBOL_VECTOR symbols in msDrawMarkerSymbolIM(). 

- Bug 1204: Added multi-threading support in mapthread.c.  List of connections 
  is managed within a mutex lock, and connections are only allowed to be used
  by one thread at a time.

- Bug 1143 : Missing call to msInitShape.

- Fixed PHP5 support for windows : Bug 1100. 

- Correct bug 1151 : generates twice a </Mark> tag when generating an SLD.
  This was happening the style did not have a size set.

- Oracle Spatial.  Fixed problem with LayerClose function.  Added token NONE
  for DATA statement.  Thanks Valik with the hints about the LayerClose problem
  and Francois with the hints about NONE token.  

- numpoints and stylelength memebers of the symbol object needs to be in sync
  with the low level values after calles to setpoints ans setstyle (Bug 1137).
 
- Use doubles instead of integers in function php3_ms_symbol_setPoints 
  (Bug 1137).

- Change the output of the expression when using a wild card for
  PropertyIsLike (Bug 1107).

- Delete temporary sld file created on disk (Bug 1123)

- Fixed msFreeFileCtx() to call free() instead of gdFree() as per bug 1125. 
  Also renamed gdFreeFileCtx() to msFreeFileCtx().

Version 4.4.0 (2004-11-29)
--------------------------

- Fixed WMS GetCapabilities 1.1.0 crash when wms_style_<...>_legendurl_*
  metadata were used (bug 1096)

- WCS GetCapabilities : Added ResponsibleParty support.

- WMS GetCapabilities : Service online resource was not url encoded (bug 1093)

  client layers using GET method (bug 1082)

- Fixed : SLD rasters was failing when there was Spatial Filter (Bug 1087) 

- Fixed mapwfslayer.c build error when WFS was not enabled (bug 1083)

- Check that we have vsnprintf in mapimagemap.c before using it. 


Version 4.4.0-beta3 (2004-11-22)
--------------------------------

- Added tests to mimimize the threat of recursion problems when evaluating
  LAYER REQUIRES or LABELREQUIRES expressions. Note that via MapScript it
  is possible to circumvent that test by defining layers with problems 
  after running prepareImage. Other things crop up in that case too (symbol 
  scaling dies) so it should be considered bad programming practice
  (bug 1059).

- Added --with-sderaster configure option. 

- Make sure that msDrawWMSLayerLow calls msDrawLayer instead of 
  msDrawRasterLayerLow directly ensuring that some logic (transparency) that 
  are in msDrawLayer are applied (bug 541).

- Force GD/JPEG outputFormatObjects to IMAGEMODE RGB and TRANSPARENT OFF
  if they are RGBA or ON.  Makes user error such as in bug 1703 less likely.

- Advertize only gd and gdal formats for wms capabilities (bug 455).

- Pass config option GML_FIELDTYPES=ALWAYS_STRING to OGR so that all GML
  attributes are returned as strings to MapServer. This is most efficient
  and prevents problems with autodetection of some attribute types (bug 1043).
  
- msOGCWKT2ProjectionObj() now uses the OGRSpatialReference::SetFromUserInput()
  method.  This allows various convenient setting options, including the 
  ability to handle ESRI WKT by prefixing the WKT string with "ESRI::". 

- Fixed GetLegendGraphic in WMS Capabilities that were missing the '?'
  or '&' separator if it was not included in wms_onlineresource (bug 1065).

- Updated WMS/WFS client and server code to lookup "ows_*" metadata names
  in addition to the default "wms_*" (or "wfs_*") metadatas (WCS was already
  implemented this way). This reduces the amount of duplication in mapfiles
  that support multiple OGC interfaces since "ows_*" metadata can be used
  almost everywhere for common metadata items shared by multiple OGC
  interfaces (bug 568).

- Added ows_service_onlineresource metadata for WMS/WFS to distinguish
  between service and GetMap/Capabilities onlineresources (bug 375).

- Added map->setSize() to PHP MapScript (bug 1066).

- Re-enabled building PHP MapScript using PHP's bundled regex/*.o. This is
  needed to build in an environment with PHP configured as an Apache DSO
  (bugs 990, 520).

- Fixed problem with raster dither support on windows (related to ascii 
  encoding pointers) (bug 722).

- Moved PHP/SWIG MapScript layer->getExtent() logic down to msLayerGetExtent()
  to avoid code duplication (bug 1051).

- Added SDE Raster drawing support (experimental).

- HTML legends: Added [leg_header_html] and [leg_footer_html] (bug 1032).

- Added "z" support in SWIG MapScript for pointObj (bug 871).

- In PHP Mpascript when using  ms_newrectobj, the members minx, miny,
  maxx, maxy are initialized to -1 (bug 788).

- Write out proper world file with remote WMS result, it was off by half
  a pixel (bug 1050).

- Send a warning in the wms capabilities if the layer status is set 
  to default (bug 638).

- Fixed PHP MapScript compile warnings: dereferencing type-punned pointer
  will break strict-aliasing rules (bug 1053).

- Added $layer->isVisible() to PHP MapScript (bug 539).

- Ported $layer->getExtent() to PHP MapScript (bug 826).

- wms_group_abstract can now be used in the capabilities (bug 754).

- If wms_stylelist is an empty string, do not output the <StyleList> tag
  for MapContexts (bug 595).

- Avoid passing FILE* to GD library by utilizing GD's gdIOCtx interface
  (bug 1047).
  
- Output warning in wms/wfs capabilities document if layer,group,map names have
  space in them (bug 486, bug 646).

- maporaclespatial.c: fixed declarations problems (bug 1044).

- Allow use of msOWSPrintURLType with no metadata. In this case the default 
  parameters will be used (bug 1001).

- Ensure the outputFormatObj attached to msImageLoadGDStream() results reflect
  the interlacedness of the loaded image.  Also ensure that the RGB PNG
  reference images work (make imagemode match gdImg) (bug 1039).

- Fixed support for non-square pixels in WCS (bug 1014).

- Expose only GD formats for GetLegendGraphic in the capabilities (bug 1001).

- Check for supported formats when process a GetLegendGraphic request 
  (bug 1030).

- mapraster.c: fixed problem with leaks in tileindexed case where the
  tile index is missing (bug 713).

- Oracle Spatial: implemented connection pool support for Oracle Spatial. 
  New layer data parameters to support query functions, added 
  "using unique <column name>".  Added "FILTER", "RELATE" and "GEOMRELATE" 
  parameters, now permit users to choose the Oracle Spatial Filter. Modified 
  the internal SQL to always apply FILTER function. And improve the Oracle 
  Spatial performance.

- Centralize "stdout binary mode setting" for win32 in msIO_needBinaryStdout().
  Use it when writing GDAL files to stdout in mapgdal.c.  Fixes problems with
  output of binary files from GDAL outputformat drivers on win32 via WMS/WCS.

- MapServer now provides one default style named (default), title and 
  LegendURL when generating capabilities.  Added also the possibility to use
  the keyword default for STYLES parameter when doing a GetMap 
  (..&STYLES=default,defeault,...) (bug 1001).

- Add xlink:type="simple" in WMS MetadataURL (bug 1027).


Version 4.4.0-beta2 (2004-11-03)
--------------------------------

- free mapServObj properly in mapserv.c in OWS dispatch case to fix minor
  memory leaks.

- modified msCloseConnections() to also close raster layers so that 
  held raster query results will be freed. 

- modified raster queries to properly set the classindex in the resultcache.

- modified msDrawQueryCache() to be very careful to not try and lookup 
  information on out-of-range classindex values.  This seems to occur when
  default shapes come back witha classindex of 0 even if there are no classes.
  (ie. raster query results). 

- the loadmapcontext function has changed it behaviour.  Before the 4.4 relase
  when loading layers from a map context, the layer name was built using
  a unique prefix + the name found in the context (eg for the 2nd layer in 
  map context named park, the layer name generated would possibly be l:2:park).
  Now the loadmapcontext takes a 2nd optional argument to force the creation
  of the unique names. The default behaviour is now to have the layer name
  equals to the name found in the context file (bug 1023).   

- Fixed problem with WMS GetCapabilities aborting when wms_layer_group is
  used for some layers but not for all (bug 1024).

- Changed raster queries to return the list of all pixel values as an 
  attribute named "value_list" rather than "values" to avoid conflict with
  special [values] substitution rule in maptemplate.c.

- Fixed raster queries to reproject results back to map projection, and to
  do point queries distance checking against the correct projection (bug 1021).

- Get rid of WMS 1.0.8 support. It's not an officially supported verison
  of the spec anyway: it's synonymous for 1.1.0 (bug 1022).

- Allow use of '=' inside HTML template tag parser (bug 978).

- Use metadata ows_schema_location for WMS/WFS/WCS/SLD (bugs 999, 1013, 938).
  The default value if metadata is not found is 
  http://schemas.opengeospatial.net.
 
- Generate a RULE <Name> tag when generating an SLD (bug 1010).

- WMS GetLegendGraphic uses now the RULE value to return an icon for
  a class that has the same name as the RULE value (bug 843).
 
- Add msOWSPrintURLType: This funciton is a generic URL printing fuction for 
  OGC specification metadata (WMS, WFS, WCS, WMC, etc.) (bug 944).

- Support MetadataURL, DataURL and LegendURL tags in WMS capabilities 
  document and MetadataURL in WFS capabilities.

- SWIG mapscript: clone methods for layerObj, classObj, styleObj (bug 1012).

- Implemented an intarray helper class for SWIG mapscript which allows for
  multi-language manipulation of layer drawing order (bugs 853, 1005).

- Fixed WMS GetLegendGraphic which was returning an exception (GD error)
  when requested layer was out of scale (bug 1006).

- Fixed maplexer.l to work with flex 2.5.31 (bug 975).

- WMS GetMap requests now have MS_NONSQUARE enabled by default. This means
  that if the width/height ratio doesn't match the extent's x/y ratio then
  the map is stretched as stated in the WMS specification (bug 862).

- In WMS, layers with no explicit projection defined will receive a copy
  of the map's projectionObj if a new SRS is specified in the GetMap request
  or if MS_NONSQUARE is enabled. This will prevent the problem with layers 
  that don't show up in WMS request when the server administrator forgets
  to explicitly set projections on all the layers in a WMS mapfile (bug 947).

- Implemented FastCGI cleanup support for win32 and unix in mapserv.c.

- Solved configure/compile issues with libiconv (bugs 909, 1017).


Version 4.4.0-beta1 (2004-10-21)
--------------------------------

- "shared" compilation target now supports some kind of versioning,
  should at least prevent libmap.so version collisions when upgrading
  MapServer on a server (bug 982).

- When no RULE parameter has been specified in the WMS request
  a legend should be returned with all classes for the specified LAYER.
  Changes has been made in mapwms.c (bug 653). Also if the SCALE parameter
  is provided in the WMS request is will be used to determine whether
  the legend of the specified layer should be drawn in the case that the
  layer is scale dependant (big 809).

- Nested layers in the capabilities are supported by using a new metadata
  tag WMS_LAYER_GROUP (bug 776).
  
- Added greyscale+alpha render support if mapdrawgdal.c (bug 965). 

- Added --with-fastcgi support to configure.

- support OGC mapcontext through mapserver cgi (bug 946).

- support for reading 3d shape file (z) (bug 869).

- add php mapscript functions to expose the z element (bug 870).

- imageObj::write() method for SWIG mapscript (bug 941).

- Protect users from 3 potential sources of threading problems: parsing
  expression strings outside of msLoadMap, evaluating mapserver logical
  expressions, and loading symbol set files outside of msLoadMap (bug 339).

- Various fixes allowing unit tests to run leak free under valgrind on 
  i686.  Memory is now properly freed when exiting from common error
  states (bug 927).

- Restored ability to render transparent (indexed or alpha) pixmap symbols
  on RGB map images, including annotation layers and embedded scalebars.
  This feature remains OFF by default for map layers and is enabled by
  specifying TRANSPARENCY ALPHA (bugs 926, 490).

- mapserv_fcgi.c removed.  Committed new comprehensive FastCGI support. 

- New mapserver exceptions for Java mapscript thanks to Umberto Nicoletti
  (bug 895).

- Removed mapindex.c, mapindex.h, shpindex.c components of old unused 
  shapefile indexing method.  

- Use the symbol size instead of 1 for the default style size value. This is
  done by setting the default size to -1 and adding msSymbolGetDefaultSize() 
  everywhere to get the default symbolsize (Bug 751).

- Correct Bug with GML BBOX output when using a <Filter> with a 
  GetFeature request (Bug 913).

- Encode all metadatas and mapfile parameters outputed in a xml document
  (Bug 802).

- Implement the ENCODING label parameter to support internationalization.
  Note this require the iconv library (Bug 858).

- New and improved Java mapscript build provided by unicoletti@prometeo.it
  and examples by Y.K. Choo (bug 876).

- MapContext: Cleanup code to make future integration more easily and output 
  SRS and DataURL in the order required by the spec.

- Fixed issue with polygon outline colors and brush caching (bug 868).

- New C# mapscript makefiles and examples provided by Y.K. Choo
  <ykchoo@geozervice.com> committed under mapscript/csharp/ (bug 867).
  
- Renamed 'string' member of labelCacheMemberObj to 'text' to avoid
  conflicts in SWIG mapscript with C# and Java types (bug 852).
  
- Fixed Bug 866 : problem when generating an sld on a pplygon layer

- SWIG mapscript: map's output image width and height should be set 
  simultaneously using new mapObj::setSize() method.  This performs
  necessary map geotransform computation.  Direct setting of map width
  and height is deprecated (bug 836).

- Fixed bug 832 (validate srs value) : When the SRS parameter in a GetMap 
  request contains a SRS that is valid for some, but not all of the layers 
  being requested, then the server shall throw a Service Exception 
  (code = "InvalidSRS"). Before this fix, mapserver use to reproject
  the layers to the requested SRS. 

- Fixed bug 834: SE_ROW_ID in SDE not initialized for unregistered SDE tables

- Fixed bug 823 : adding a validation of the SRS parameter when doing
  a GetMap request on a wms server. Here is the OGC statement :
  'When the SRS parameter in a GetMap request contains a SRS 
  that is valid for some, but not all of the layers being requested, 
  then the server shall throw a Service Exception (code = "InvalidSRS").'

- Set the background color of polygons or circles when using transparent
  PIXMAP symbol.

- SWIG mapscript class extensions are completely moved from mapscript.i
  into separate interface files under mapscript/swiginc.

- Overhaul of mapscript unit testing framework with a comprehensive test
  runner mapscript/python/tests/runtests.py.

- Modified the MS_VALID_EXTENT macro to take an extent as its argument 
  instead of the quartet of members. MapServer now checks that extents input 
  through the mapfile are valid in mapfile.c (web, map, reference, 
  and layer).  Modified msMapSetExtent in mapobject.c to use the new 
  macro instead of its home-grown version. Modified all cases that used 
  MS_VALID_EXTENT to the new use case.
  
- Layers now accept an EXTENT through the mapfile (bug 786). Nothing 
  is done with it at this point, and getExtent still queries the 
  datasource rather than getting information from the mapfile-specified 
  extent.

- Fixed problem with WMS GetFeatureInfo when map was reprojected. Was a
  problem with msProjectRect and zero-size search rectangles (bug 794)

- MapServer version now output to mapscriptvars and read by Perl Makefile.PL
  and Python setup.py (bug 795).

- Map.web, layer, and class metadata are exposed in SWIG mapscript as
  first-class objects (bug 737).

- Add support for spatial filters in the SLD (Bug 782)

- A few fixes to allow php_mapscript to work with both PHP4 and PHP5.
  PHP5 support should still be considered experimental. (bug 718)

- Fixed SDE only recognizing SE_ROW_ID as the unique column (bug 536). 
  The code now autosenses the unique row id column.

- Enhanced SDE support to include support for queries against 
  user-specified versions.  The version name can be specified as the 
  last parameter of the CONNECTION string.

- Fixed automated generation of onlineresource in OWS GetCapabilities
  when the xxx_onlineresource metadata is not specified: the map= parameter
  used to be omitted and is now included in the default onlineresource if
  it was explicitly set in QUERY_STRING (bug 643)

- Fixed possible crash when producing WMS errors INIMAGE (bug 644)

- Fixed automated generation of onlineresource in OWS GetCapabilities
  when the xxx_onlineresource metadata is not specified: the map= parameter
  used to be omitted and is now included in the default onlineresource if
  it was explicitly set in QUERY_STRING (bug 643)

- Fixed an issue with annotation label overlap. There was an issue with
  the way msRectToPolygon was computing it's bounding box. (bug 618)

- Removed "xbasewohoo" debug output when using JOINs and fixed a few 
  error messages related to MySQL joins (bug 652)

- Fixed "raster cracking" problem (bug 493)

- Improvements to Makefile.vc, and nmake.opt so that a mapscriptvars file
  can be produced on windows.  

- Updated setup.py so Python MapScript builds on win32. 

- Added preliminary raster query support.

- No more Python-stopping but otherwise benign errors raised from
  msDrawWMSLayer() (bug 650).

- Finished prototyping all MapServer functions used by SWIG-Mapscript
  and added 'void' to prototypes of no-arg functions, eliminating all
  but two SWIG-Mapscript build warnings (bug 658).

- Mapscript: resolved issue with pens and dynamic drawing of points (bug 663).

- Mapscript: fixes to tests of shape copying and new image symbols.

- Mapscript: new OWSRequest class based on cgiRequestObj structure in 
  cgiutil.h is a first step to allow programming with MapServer's OWS
  dispatching (bug 670).

- Mapscript: styles member of classObj structure is no longer exposed to
  SWIG (bug 611).

- Implementation geotransform/rotation support in cgi core, and mapscript.i.

- Testing: fixed syntax error, 'EPSG' -> 'epsg' in test.map (bug 687).
  Added an embedded scalebar which demonstrates that bug 519 is fixed.
  The test data package is also made more complete by including two fonts
  from Bitstream's open Vera fonts (bug 694).

- Mapscript (SWIG): remove promote and demote methods from layerObj.  Use
  of container's moveLayerUp/moveLayerDown is better, and this brings
  the module nearer to PHP-Mapscript (bug 692).

- mapogr.cpp: Now echos CPLGetLastErrorMsg() results if OGR open fails. 

- mapraster.c: fixed tile index corruption problem (bug 698)

- Mladen Turk's map copying macros in mapcopy.h clean up map cloning and
  allow for copying of fontset and symbolset.  Added cloning tests in
  python/tests/testCloneMap.py and refactored testing suite (bugs 640 & 701).

- Mapscript: removing obsolete python/setup_wnone.py file.

- CONFIG MS_NONSQUARE YES now enables non-square pixel mode (mostly for WMS). 
  Changes in mapdraw.c (msDrawMap()) to use the geotransform "hack" to allow
  non-square pixels.

- When using the text/html mime type in a GetFeature request, if the
  layer's template is not set to a valid file, errors occur.
  Correction is : the text/html is not advertized by default and 
  will only be advertized if the user has defined 
  "WMS_FEATURE_INFO_MIME_TYPE"  "text/html" (bug 736)

- Make PHP MapScript's layer->open() produce a PHP Warning instead of a
  Fatal error (bug 742)

- MapServer hash tables are now a structure containing a items pointer
  to hashObj. See maphash.h for new prototypes of hash table functions.
  In SWIG mapscript, Map, Layer, and Class metadata are now instances of the
  new hashTableObj class.  fontset.fonts and Map.configoptions are also
  instances of hashTableObj.  The older getMetaData/setMetaData and
  metadata iterator methods can be deprecated (bug 737).
  
- Mapscript-SWIG: made the arguments of mapObj and layerObj constructors
  optional.  A layerObj can now exist outside of a map and can be added
  to a mapObj using the insertLayer method.  mapObj.removeLayer now 
  returns a copy of the removed Layer rather than an integer (bug 759).

- Fixed $map->processTemplate() which was always returning NULL.
  Bug introduced in version 4.0 in all flavours of MapScript (bug 410)


Version 4.2-beta1 (2004-04-17)
------------------------------

- Added support for WMS 1.1.1 in the WMS interface. 

- Added support for WMS-SLD in client and server mode.

- Added support for attribute filters in the WFS interface.

- WMS Interface: several fixes to address issues found in running tests
  against the OGC testsuite. One of the side-effects is that incomplete
  GetMap requests that used to work in previous versions will produce
  errors now (see bug 622).

- Modified configure scripts to be able to configure/build PHP MapScript
  using an installed PHP instead of requiring the full source tree.

- Added ability to combine multiple WMS connections to the same server 
  into a single request when the layers are adjacent and compatible. (bug 116)

- Support POSTed requests without Content-Length set. 

- Added support for proper classification of non-8bit rasters.  

- Added support for BYTE rawmode output type. 

- Added support for multiple bands of output in rawmode. 

- MySQL joins available

- Fixed problems with detection of OGRRegisterAll() with GDAL 1.1.9 in 
  configure due to GDAL's library name change. Fixed a few other minor
  issues with GDAL/OGR in configure.

- Modified configure to disable native TIFF/PNG/JPEG/GIF support by default
  if GDAL is enabled.  You can still enable them explicitly if you like.

- Replace wms_style_%s_legendurl, wms_logourl, wms_descriptionurl, wms_dataurl 
  and wms_metadataurl metadata by four new metadata by metadata replaced. The 
  new metadata are called legendurl_width, legendurl_height, legendurl_format, 
  legendurl_href, logourl_width, etc...
  Old dependancy to the metadata with four value in it , space separated, are 
  not kept.

- Implement DataURL, MetadataURL and DescriptionURL metadata in 
  mapcontext.c (bug 523)

- PHP MapScript's pasteImage() now takes a hex color value (e.g. 0xrrggbb)
  for the transparent color instead of a color index. (bug 463)

- OGR data sources with relative paths are now checked relative to 
  SHAPEPATH first, and if not found then we try again relative to the
  mapfile location.  (bug 295)

- There is a new mapObj parameter called MAXSIZE to control maximum image
  size to serve via the CGI and WMS interfaces. The default is 2048 as 
  before but it can be changed in the map file now. (bug 435)

- Added simple dataset for unit and regression tests (bug 453)

- PostGIS: added postresql_NOTICE_HANDLER() sending output via msDebug() 
  and only when layer->debug is set (bug 418)

- Added Apache version detection in configure and added non-blocking flag
  on stderr in msDebug() to work around Apache 2.x bug (bug 458)

- MapScript rectObj: added optional bounding value args to constructor and
  extended rectObj class with a toPolygon method (bug 508).
  
- MapScript pointObj: added optional x/y args to constructor (bug 508).

- MapScript colorObj: added optional RGB color value args to colorObj
  constructor, and extended colorObj class with setRGB, setHex, and toHex
  methods.  The hex methods use hex color strings like '#ffffff' rather
  than '0xffffff' for compatibility with HTML (bug 509).

- MapScript outputFormatObj: extended with a getOption method (bug 510). 

- MapScript imageObj: added optional mapObj argument to the save method
  resolving bug 549 without breaking current API.  Also added optional
  driver and filename arguments to constructor which allows imageObj
  instances to be created with a specified driver or from files on disk
  (bug 530).  Added new code to Python MapScript which extends the 
  filename option to Python file-like objects (bug 550). This means
  StringIO and urllib's network objects!

- MapScript classObj and styleObj: added a new styleObj shadow class and
  extended classObj with getStyle, insertStyle, and removeStyle methods.
  MapScript now supports multiple styles for dynamically created classes
  (bug 548).

- MapScript layerObj: added getExtent, getNumFeatures extension methods,
  allowing getShape to access inline features (bug 562).

- Added fixes for AMD64/Linux in configure (bug 565)

- Removed OGR_STATIC stuff in configure script that used to allow us to 
  build with OGR statically by pointing to the OGR source tree.  That 
  means you can only build with OGR when *installed* as part of GDAL,
  but that's what everyone is doing these days anyway.

- Mapscript outputFormatObj: extended constructor to allow format names,
  and mapObj methods to append and remove output formats from the 
  outputformatlist (bug 511).

- New SWIG mapscript development documentation in the spirit of the
  PHP-Mapscript readme file, but using reST (bug 576).

- Paving way for future changes to SWIG mapscript API with new features
  enabled by NEXT_GENERATION_API symbol (bug 586).

- Added ability to set string member variables to NULL in PHP MapScript
  (bug 591)

- New key iterators for map, layer, and class metadata hash tables 
  (bug 434) and fontset fonts hash table (bug 439).

- Fixed potential crash when using nquery with a querymap enabled and
  some layers have a template set at the layer level instead of inside
  classes (bug 569).

- New CONFIG keyword in the MAP object in a .map file to be used
  to set external configuration parameters such as PROJ_LIB and control
  of some GDAL and OGR driver behaviours (bug 619)

Version 4.0 (2003-08-01)
------------------------

- Fixed problem with truncated expressions (bugs 242 and 340)

- Attempt at fixing GD vs libiconv dependency problems (bug 348)

- Fixed problem with invalid BoundingBox tag in WMS capabilities (bug 34)

- Fixed problems with SIZEUNITS not working properly (bug 373)

- Fixed MacOSX configure problems for linking php_mapscript (bug 208)

- Fixed problem with reference map marker symbol not showing up (bug 378)

- Use <Keywords> in WMS 1.0.0 capabilities instead of <KeywordList> (bug 129)

- One-to-one and one-to-many joins now work for Xbase files and are available
  to query templates. Low level one-to-one Xbase joins are available  via
  OGR.

Version 4.0-beta2 (2003-07-11)
------------------------------

- Added prototype of FastCGI support in mapserv_fcgi.c (not built by default).

- Report full error stack in the mapserv CGI and PHP MapScript (bug 346)

- Old index (.qix) format is deprecated (bug 273)

- Fixed problem with embedded legend and scalebar that would result in
  layers being added to the HTML legends (bug 171)

- Changed joins (XBase only at this point) over to the open-prepare-next...
  next-close way of doing things. Compiles fine, but needs more testing. 
  One-to-many support should work now but it needs to be hooked into the 
  template code yet.  Last thing before a candidate 4.0 release.

- Added ability to generate images in MapScript processQueryTemplate (bug 341)

- Added saving of output formats in msSaveMap()

- Fixed problem in PHP MapScript with variables that were not dereferenced
  before their values were changed by the MapScript wrappers (bug 323)

- Added support for Web Map Context 1.0.0

- Treat zero-length template values as NULL so that it's possible to
  set("template", "") from MapScript to make layer non-queryable (bug 338)

- Ditched the shapepath argument to the shapefileObj constructor

- CARTOLINE join style default changed to MS_CJC_NONE

- Tweaked code in legend builder to handle polygon layers slightly different.
  Now if a polygon layer contains only outlines and no fills (i.e. a polyline)
  then it is drawn using the zigzag legend shape rather than the box. I'll 
  add legend outlines back in shortly.

- Restored legend key outlines (triggered by setting OUTLINECOLOR). If an 
  outline is requested then line symbols are clipped to the outline, 
  otherwise lines are allowed to bleed a pixel or two beyond those 
  boundaries- for most cases this looks	fine but for fat lines it is 
  gonna look goofy regardless. In those cases use the KEYIMAGE.

- Fixed a bug in the scanline writer so that x coordinates can be in any 
  order when passed in to the function. (bug 336)

- Updated loadExpressionString in mapfile.c to be a bit more tolerant of
  input. Now if a string does not match the logical or regex pattern it is
  automatically cast as a string expression. Removes the need for silly quotes.


Version 4.0-beta1 (2003-06-06)
------------------------------

- Added imagemap outputformat, which makes possible use of client-side 
  imagemaps in browsers.

- Added MySQL support for non-spatial OpenGIS Simple Features SQL stored data

- msQueryByShape and msQueryByFeature honor layer tolerances. In effect you
  can to buffered queries now. At the momoment only polygon select features
  are supported, but there's nothing inherent in the underlying computations
  that says lines won't work as well.

- Simple one-to-one joins are working again. Reworked the join code so that
  table connections are persistant within a join (across joins is a todo).
  Joins, like layers are wrapped with a connection neutral front end, that
  sets us up to do MySQL or whatever in addition to XBase.

- Removed shapepath argument to all layer access functions (affects MapScript).
  It's still used but we leverage the layer pointer back to the parent mapObj
  so the API is cleaner.

- Changed default presentation of feature attributes to escape a few 
  problematic characters for HTML display (eg. > becomes &gt;). 
  Added [itemname_raw] substitution to allow access to unaltered data.

- Added initial version of Jan Hartman's connection pooling code.

- Replaced libwww with libcurl for WMS/WFS client HTTP requests.
  (libcurl 7.10 required, see http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/)

- Added CONNECTION to the list of mapfile parameters that can accept 
  %variable% substitutions when processed by the cgi version. This is useful
  for passing in username and/or passwords to database data sources.

- Added support for DATA and TEMPLATE (header/footer/etc...) filtering using
  an regex declared in the mapfile (DATAPATTERN and TEMPLATEPATTERN). 
  Certain parameters in a mapfile cannot be changed via a URL without first
  being filtered.

- Added support for enviroment variable MS_MAPFILE_PATTERN. This allows you to
  override the default regex in favor of one more restrictive (I would hope) of
  your own.

- Disabled CGI SAVEMAP option.

- Removed CGI TEMPLATE option since you can use the map_web_template syntax.
  Simplifies security maintenance by only having to deal with this option 
  in a single place.

- Added offset support (styleObj) for raster based output (GD for sure, not
  quite sure how OGR output is created although I believe is uses GD anyway).
  This allows for feature drop shadows and support for cool linear symbols
  like used to be supported in pre-3.4 versions. These offsets are not 
  scalable at the moment.

- Null shapes (attributes but no vertices) are skipped for shapefiles using
  the msLayerNextShape interface. Otherwise applications should check the
  shapeObj type member for MS_SHAPE_NULL.

- Changed where label cache is allocated and cleared. Now it isn't allocated 
  until drawing takes place. Any old cache is cleared before a new one is
  allocated. The cache is still intact following rendering for post-processing
  using MapScript.

- Fixed screw up in pre-processing of logical expressions for item lists.
  Under certain circumstances that list could get corrupted and expressions
  would fail.

- Added NOT operator to expression parser.

- Added layer and map level DEBUG options to map file.

- Major changes to support vector output (PDF, SWF, GML, ...):
  imageObj is used by all rendering functions instead of gdImagePtr,
  New msSaveImage() prototype

- Support for GD-2.0, including 24 bits output.  Dropped support for GD 1.x

- Support for output to any GDAL-supported format via the new OUTPUTFORMAT
  object.

- New styleObj to replace the OVERLAY* parameter in classes.

- PostGIS: Added Sean Gillies <sgillies@i3.com>'s patch for "using unique 
  <column name>". Added "using SRID=#" to specify a spatial reference 
  for an arbitrary sql query.

- ... and numerous fixes not listed here...


Version 3.6.0-beta1 (2002-04-30)
--------------------------------

- MapScript: qitem and qstring params added to layer->queryByAttribute().
  Instead of being driven by the layer's FILTER/FILTERITEM, the query by
  attribute is now driven by the values passed via qitem,qstring, and the 
  layer's FILTER/FILTERITEM are ignored.

- Symbol and MapFile changes: ANTIALIAS and FILLED keywords now take a
  boolean (TRUE/FALSE) argument i.e. ANTIALIAS becomes ANTIALIAS TRUE
  and FILLED becomes FILLED TRUE

- Reference Map:
  Added options to show a different marker when the reference box becomes
  too small.  See the mapfile reference docs for more details on the new 
  reference object parameters (MARKER, MARKERSIZE, MAXBOXSIZE, MINBOXSIZE)

- Added MINSCALE/MAXSCALE at the CLASS level.

- Support for tiled OGR datasets.

- PHP 4.1.2 and 4.2.0 support for PHP MapScript.

- Added LAYER TRANSPARENCY, value between 1-100

- Fixes to the SWIG interface for clean Java build.

- New HTML legend templates for CGI and MapScript.  See HTML-Legend-HOWTO.

- WMS server now supports query results using HTML query templates instead
  of just plain/text.

- Added support functions for thread safety (--with-thread).  Still not 
  100% thread-safe.


Version 3.5.0 (2002-12-18)
--------------------------

- No Revision history before version 3.5
