Summary
-------
   
MapServer is a system for developing web-based GIS applications. 
The basic system consists of a CGI program that can be configured to 
respond to a variety of spatial requests like making maps, scalebars, 
and point, area and feature queries. Virtually all aspects of an 
application, from web interface to map appearance can be developed 
without any programming. For the more ambitious user, MapServer 
applications can be enhanced using Python, PHP, Java, JavaScript or 
many other web technologies. For more  information and complete 
documentation please visit:

Bug reports and enhancement submissions can be reported in the MapServer 
issue tracker at the following url.   If you do make changes and/or enhancements, 
please let us know so that they might be incorporated into future releases.
