MapServer Test Data
===================

This is a self-contained lightweight dataset that is used as a test fixture
for MapServer unit tests.  It might also be used for regression testing or
by users that want to verify their build by executing::

    $ ./map2img -m tests/test.map -o test.png

Currently (Oct/2004) only the Python mapscript unit tests and the Java 
mapscript "make test" target use these data.

For information on the Python MapScript unit tests see
 
    ../mapscript/python/tests/TESTING.TXT
