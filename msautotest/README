Send new tests via MapServer Issue Tracker at https://github.com/MapServer/MapServer/issues/
(use the label 'Msautotest').

Note that a number of tests expect to be run under Ubuntu 20.04 with the prerequisites
of ci/setup.sh to yield the expected test results. A Vagrant environment
(https://mapserver.org/development/tests/vagrant.html) can be conveniently used
to meet those prerequisites.
