#
# Test of classification methods on a floating point input with provided
# scaling that causes merging of some original values throwing off results.
# In particular, a substantial chunk of data that should have fallen into the
# last class will be ignored because it is outside the scaling range.  Also, 
# values like -4 will now fall into the green class because the fall into the
# 0 to -5.25 bucket which is averaged to -2.675 for classification purposes.
