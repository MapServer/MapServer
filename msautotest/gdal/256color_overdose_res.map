# Tests layering a layer with transparency on a layer with 256 colors already.
# This is intended to address case where colors are exausted before a 
# transparent color can be allocated.
#
# NOTE: with resampling.
#
# ISSUE: The resulting image has the grid drawn in a grey color instead of
#        the natural red.  This is because the colormap is full by the time
#        we get to allocating a color for the grid.  This is an expected
#        "error" in the results.
#
# UPDATE: Now mapdrawgdal.c constructs a colortable for greyscale images
#         with only 128 entries instead of 256 so the "overload" no longer
#         happens.  Preserve test with new results for posterity.
#
# REQUIRES: SUPPORTS=PROJ
