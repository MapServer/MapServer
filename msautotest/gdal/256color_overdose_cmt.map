# Tests layering a layer with transparency on a layer with 256 colors already.
# This is intended to address case where colors are exhausted before a 
# transparent color can be allocated.
#
# NOTE: without resampling.
#
# ISSUE: The resulting image has the grid drawn in a grey color instead of
#        the natural red.  This is because the colormap is full by the time
#        we get to allocating a color for the grid.  This is an expected
#        "error" in the results.
