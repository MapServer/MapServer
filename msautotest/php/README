To run these tests you need PHPUnit (and PHP's Xdebug extension) installed. 
You can find how to install PHPUnit at https://phpunit.readthedocs.io .  
The official PHPUnit site is: https://phpunit.de

To run the tests simply run 'phpunit --debug .' from inside the /msautotest/php/
folder.

You can run a single test such as: 'phpunit --debug classObjTest.php'
