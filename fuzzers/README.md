This directory contain fuzzer main functions and scripts for the
Google OSS Fuzz project: https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/

The main Dockerfile is in:
https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/blob/master/projects/mapserver/Dockerfile
and use the build.sh script and fuzzer source code in this
(https://github.com/MapServer/MapServer/blob/main/fuzzers) directory.

The list of issues is in:
https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/list?q=mapserver

- Build fuzzer reproducer programs (BUILD_FUZZER_REPRODUCER=ON is the default)
  ```
    $ cmake -DBUILD_FUZZER_REPRODUCER=ON /path/to/source/root
    $ make
  ```

  Run one against a reproducer file (typically generated by OSS Fuzz):
  ```
    $ fuzzers/shapefuzzer_reproducer path_to_reproducer_file
  ```

- Run locally OSS Fuzz:
  ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz.git
    $ cd oss-fuzz
    $ export PROJECT_NAME=mapserver
    # if you want to run it against your own MapServer fork & branch,
    # you need to edit projects/mapserver/Dockerfile and comment out the following line:
    # #RUN git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/MapServer/MapServer
    # and replace it with something like
    # RUN git clone --depth 1 --branch ossfuzz_run_live_and_minimal_gdal https://github.com/rouault/MapServer
    $ python infra/helper.py build_image $PROJECT_NAME
  ```

  Build fuzzers with the address sanitizer (could use undefined, etc...)
  ```
    $ python infra/helper.py build_fuzzers --sanitizer address $PROJECT_NAME
  ```

  Test a particular fuzzer (replace shapefuzzer by other fuzzers)
  ```
    $ python infra/helper.py run_fuzzer $PROJECT_NAME shapefuzzer
  ```

- Build fuzzer programs for local fuzzing against current MapServer build.
  Requires to use CLang as compiler.
  ```
    $ cmake -DBUILD_FUZZER_REPRODUCER=OFF -DFUZZER=ON /path/to/source/root
    $ make
  ```

  Run the shapefuzzer:
  ```
    $ fuzzers/shapefuzzer
  ```
