MapServer 4.8 to 4.10 Migration Guide
=====================================

This page documents the changes that must be made to MapServer 
applications when migrating from version 4.8.x (or earlier versions) 
to 4.10.x (i.e. backwards incompatibilities), as well as information
on some of the new features.

----------------------------------------------------
SWIG MapScript (Python, Perl, Csharp, Java) changes
----------------------------------------------------

Immutable internal structures 
------------------------------

According `bug 1803`_ setting the following object members were identified
as potential unsafe operations causing unexpected access violations and
were made immutable (read-only). The members are created by default so
there's no need to create those from scratch.

::

    layerObj.metadata
    classObj.label
    classObj.metadata
    fontSetObj.fonts
    legendObj.label
    mapObj.symbolset,
    mapObj.fontset
    mapObj.labelcache
    mapObj.reference
    mapObj.scalebar
    mapObj.legend
    mapObj.querymap
    mapObj.web
    mapObj.configoptions
    webObj.metadata
    
The common characteristic of the members is that those are internal
structures (not references to external objects) having subsequent references.
By allowing to set these items one could use the following 
code to set the object.

::

    mapObj map = new mapObj("mymap.map");
    webObj web = new webObj();
    web.imagepath = "/tmp/";
    web.imageurl = "http://");
    map.web = web;

Setting the mapObj.web member a shallow copy of the structure takes place.
The subsequent references of the webObj are not be copied becoming candidates 
to be destroyed twice.  Instead of creating a new object the already 
created one should be read and used as:

::

    mapObj map = new mapObj("mymap.map");
    webObj web = map.web;
    web.imagepath = "/tmp/";
    web.imageurl = "http://");

Immutable references to parent objects
--------------------------------------

The following object members are references to parent objects and were
also made immutable. The values of these members are set internally. It makes
no sense to set these items since the parent-child relationship between the
objects are set by other member functions like (insertClass).

::

    classObj.layer
    legendObj.map
    webObj.map
    referenceMapObj.map

Setting these members should be avoided.    
    
imageObj.format now immutable
-----------------------------

imageObj.format is now immutable can can no longer explicitly be set 
with an assignment operation.   

shapeObj.initValue and default values 
-------------------------------------

When constructing a new shapeObj 4 predefined values were implicitly created 
that could be accessed and modified using getValue and setValue. Using 
this shape as a parameter of other functions like layerObj.getShape might 
result in memory leak.So as to allow explicit creation of the values the 
shapeObj.initValues was introduced. The user can initialize arbitrary 
number of the values and use getValue and setValue to access them. Beware 
of using these objects as out parameters.

layerObj.labelitemindex, .labelsizeitemindex, .labelangleitemindex 
------------------------------------------------------------------

These members were hidden entirely from the SWIG interface since the
elements are handled internally. Setting these elements for the interface
might cause access violations. (See bug 1906)

----------------------------------------------------
libgd 
----------------------------------------------------

1px Anti-Aliasing and segfaults
--------------------------------

libgd has apparently fallen out of maintenance by its primary developer.  A 
release has not been made since 11/03/04 (libgd 2.0.33), and one very 
significant bug will *always* cause a segfault when using this library 
without a patch and you attempt to do one pixel wide antialiasing.

In gd.c, function gdImageSetAAPixelColor() change:

::

    int dr,dg,db,p,r,g,b;
    p = gdImageGetPixel(im,x,y);

to

::

    int dr,dg,db,p,r,g,b;
    if (!gdImageBoundsSafeMacro (im, x, y)) return;
    p = gdImageGetPixel(im,x,y);

More detail about this patch (if you need any) was described by Steve Lime 
in a `post to mapserver-users`_.  *NOTE*: Windows builds that are built 
with the buildkit (this includes MS4W) have this patch already and do not 
need to be updated.

Curved label support
--------------------

ANGLE FOLLOW, a new feature that allows MapServer to draw curved labels 
about a linear feature like a road, requires libgd 2.0.29 and TrueType 
font support.  Configure should autodetect if you have a sufficient 
libgd and TrueType support to be able to use this feature.

----------------------------------------------------
GEOS
----------------------------------------------------

As of version 4.10, MapServer now uses the GEOS C API for doing 
geometric algebra and predicate operations.  All of the operators 
available to the GEOS C API are available in MapScript.  Some operators 
are available through the MapServer CGI interface.  See the `SWIG MapScript`_ 
for details.

Multiple subsystems' use of the GEOS C API
------------------------------------------

It is important to note that both OGR and the Python Cartographic Library 
(and possibly other applications linked to the GEOS C API within the same process) 
also can (and often do) take advantage of the GEOS C API.  A bug in GEOS 
2.2.2 and 2.2.3 will cause a segfault during teardown as a result of the 
C API keeping its global GeometryFactory around and not properly 
accounting for it.  GEOS 3.0 should do the right thing in this instance.

----------------------------------------------------
Java Mapscript and ENUMERATED VALUES
----------------------------------------------------

Since the Java language lacks support for enums (it's been added in version 5, but
not everybody uses that) java mapscript historically had enumerated values like
MS_IMAGEMODE exposed as static integers in the mapscriptConstants interface
or in its implementor, the mapscript class.
Starting with Swig 1.3.24 the wrapper *by default* will generate specific classes for
named enums and keep anonymous enums in the mapscriptConstants class.
This has the side effect that code generated by older versions of swig will not
be portable to that generated by swig >= 1.3.24.

FIX
---

You can instruct swig to revert to the old behaviour by uncommenting line 6
in mapscript/java/javamodule.i

OGC Web Mapping Service (WMS)
----------------------------------------------------

WMS GetFeatureInfo in text/plain format
---------------------------------------

Before MapServer 4.10, WMS GetFeatureInfo output in text/plain format 
used to always return the values of *all* attributes for the selected
shapes in a given layer and there was no way to control which attributes
would be returned. This was a problem for WMS server administrators who
needed to control the list of attributes to return or to hide some 
attributes from the underlying dataset.

Starting with MapServer 4.10, the behavior of text/plain GetFeatureInfo
output has been brought in sync with that of GML output: by default 
no attributes are returned unless the wms_include_items and 
wms_exclude_items layer-level metadata are used. (See bug 1761)

For more details see the gml_include_items and gml_exclude_items layer 
object metadata docs in the WMS Server HOWTO at 
http://mapserver.gis.umn.edu/docs/howto/wms_server/#layer-object-metadata

The GML output is controlled with gml_include_items and gml_exclude_items.
The text/plain output is controlled with wms_include_items and 
wms_exclude_items.
Both GML and text/plain can also be configured using a common pair of 
ows_include_items and ows_exclude_items layer-level metadata entries.

OGC Web Feature Service (WFS)
----------------------------------------------------


Requirement for gml_featureid
-----------------------------

The WFS 1.0.0 specification states that the 'fid' attribute on GML features
returned in response to a GetFeature is required (see bug 1759).

Since MapServer 4.8 it was already possible to specify the attribute to 
use as fid using the "gml_featureid" metadata, but that was not a requirement.

MapServer 4.10 has been modified to produce a warning in the GetCapabilities
and GetFeature output if the gml_featureid metadata is not set or if the
item that it refers to does not exist in the layer (see bugs 1781 and 1782).
