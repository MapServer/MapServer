Ruby MapScript Interface
------------------------

BUILD
-----

The files that are required to create the library 'mapscript.so' : 
 mapscript.i 
 extconf.rb

Be sure that you have installed SWIG version 1.3a5 or greater.
The installation is tested with ruby version 1.6 and 1.8.

To build type :

# ruby extconf.rb
# make


INSTALL
-------

If you don't want to install the library, you have to add the library
path as argument to the command (ruby -I[path/to/the/library] ...).

To install type as 'root' user : 

# make install


EXAMPLES
--------

To run the examples:
Go to the directory of the examples

# cd examples


Run the example to receive information about a shape file

# ruby shpinfo.rb [path/shapefile.shp]
or if you don't have executed 'make install'
# ruby -I[path/to/mapscript.so] shpinfo.rb [path/shapefile.shp]

e.g.: # ruby -I.. shpinfo.rb lake2spy.shp

Run the example to create a PNG file from a shape file. The output
will be in the file [shapefile].png.

# ruby shp2img.rb [path/shapefile.shp]
or
# ruby -I[path/to/mapscript.so] shp2img.rb [path/shapefile.shp]
e.g.: # ruby -I.. shp2img.rb lake2spy.shp
