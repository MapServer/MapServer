Python MapScript Unit Tests
========================================

Running the tests
-----------------

To run all of the tests, change directory to cases and execute
::

    $ cd cases
    $ python runalltests.py -v
    
This runs all tests found in every TestCase derived class defined in any
module named "cases/*test.py".  The tests cannot be run properly from
another path.  The unit test script will insert the local build directory
produced by Python distutils into the head of the Python PATH.  This allows
us to run the unit tests before installing the mapscript module.  The unit
tests use a map config file, symbolset file, fontset file, and data located
in the 'tests' directory of the mapserver distribution.

If you encounter any errors, please create a new issue in the MapServer
bug tracker

    http://mapserver.gis.umn.edu/bugs/enter_bug.cgi

under the SWIG-MapScript component.  Copy the relevant error messages
and we'll get to the bug ASAP.  Thanks!
