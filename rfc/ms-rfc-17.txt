:Status: proposed
:Version: MapServer 5.0

Purpose
--------

Modify the MapServer core libraries so that lists of layers, classes
and styles are dynamic, not fixed to compile limits MS_MAXCLASSES, 
MS_MAXSTYLES, MS_MAXLAYERS and MS_MAXSYMBOLS.


MS_MAXSYMBOLS
-------------

Change symbolSetObj so that this::

  int numsymbols;
  symbolObj symbol[MS_MAXSYMBOLS];

becomes::

  int numsymbols;
  int maxsymbols; 
  symbolObj **symbol;

Add the following function to ensure there is at least one free entry in 
the symbol array in the symbolSetObj.  This function will only grow the
allocated array of pointers if needed (if maxsymbols == numsymbols) and 
will then allocate a new symbolObj if symbol[numsymbols] == NULL.  The new 
entries in the array will be set to NULL and the new symbolObj[numsymbols]
will be all set to zero bytes.  

::

  symbolObj *msGrowSymbolSet( symbolSetObj * );

* Modify all places that add new symbols to call msGrowSymbolsSet() to ensure
  there is space.  These locations can be fairly easily identified by 
  greping on MS_MAXSYMBOLS.

* Modify all places that access symbols by index to use the proper way
  to reference symbols in the new array, possibly using a GET_SYMBOL() macro
  similar to the GET_LAYER() added in MS-RFC-24 for layers.

* mapsymbol.c: Modify msInitSymbolSet() to initially setup the symbol set with 
  an array of just one symbol.

* There should be no swig mapscript changes required as it already uses 
  msAppendSymbol().  


MS_MAXLAYERS
------------

* map.h: Since RFC-24 already converted the array of layers in a mapObj to 
  an array of pointers, we only need to add "int maxlayers;" to mapObj to 
  indicate the current allocation size of layers array.  Note that this 
  also determines the size of the mapObj layerorder array.

* mapdraw.c: Change msDrawMap() to use map->numlayers in place of current 
  MS_MAXLAYERS for asOWSReqInfo array.

* mapobject.c: Add msGrowMapLayers(mapObj*) function to ensure there is room
  for at least one more layer on the map.  This grows layers, and layerorder
  arrays.

* mapobject.c: modify msInsertLayer() and mapscript layer constructor code (see last item) to use msGrowMapLayers().

* mapfile.c: set maxlayers to MS_MAXLAYERS and allocate layers accordingly in
  initMap().  Use msGrowMapLayers() before calling loadLayer() and 
  loadLayerValue() when parsing.

* mappluginlayer.c: make dynamic.  I'm not exactly sure what there is a
  static factory with entries dimensioned by the number of layers. 

* It looks like swig mapscript already has an mapObj.insertLayer() method
  using msInsertLayer() which should be safe.  Do mapscript applications
  sometimes just update the layers and numlayers directly?
  Answer: all layer manipulation
  is done by the layer constructor (when a not null mapObj is passed as only argument)
  or by msInsertLayer. Must modify the layer constructor as well.


MS_MAXCLASSES
-------------

* map.h: Add maxclasses field in layerObj (RFC-24 already converted the 
  array of classes in a layerObj to an array of pointers).

* layerobject.c: Modify msInsertClass() and mapscript constructor code (like for layers) to use msGrowLayerClasses(). 

* layerobject.c: Add msGrowLayerClasses() to ensure there is at least one
  extra class in the classes list. 

* mapdraw.c: colorbuffer and mindistancebuffer in msDrawQueryLayer() will need
  to be dynamically sized and allocated on the heap. 

* mapfile.c: initLayer() will need to initialize maxclasses to MS_MAXCLASSES, 
  and allocate class list accordingly.

* mapogcsld.c: modify to use msGrowLayerClasses() instead of checking limit. 


MS_MAXSTYLES
------------

* map.h: add maxstyles field to classObj (RFC-24 already converted the 
  array of styles in a classObj to an array of pointers).

* mapfile.c: set maxstyles to MS_MAXSTYLES and allocate accordingly in 
  initClass().  Use msGrowClassStyles() as apppriate. 

* classoject.c: Add msGrowClassStyles() to ensure there is an unused class. 

* classobject.c: Use msGrowClassStyles() in msInsertStyle() and in the style constructor.

Questions from the review period
--------------------------------

* Has the following issue already been dealt with by RFC-24 since the code
  already allocates less than MS_MAX_LAYERS in initMap()? Did RFC-24
  make it a formal requirement to use the proper insert/add methods to 
  add layers, styles and classes?


Answer: the implementation adopted with RFC-24 tries to save memory by only allocating the number of layers that are
effectively needed. A map with 5 layers will allocate exactly 5 layers, a map with 50 layers
will allocate 50, and so on up to the hard-coded limit of MS_MAX_LAYERS. This is also true
for classes and style.

The arrays of pointers are for obvious reasons always allocated to MS_MAX_LAYERS size, but memory
usage is reduced anyway because arrays of pointers are much smaller that arrays of structs.
This represents a substantial change from before, when MS_MAX_LAYERS blank layers where always allocated
causing a sure waste of memory in small maps.

RFC-17 should then invoke the various msGrow*() methods to grow the arrays when numlayers == maxlayers-1.
I'd suggest to grow the array to a sensible size (like half of the current size) as the impact on memory
allocation is going to be mitigated by the dynamic allocation approach introduced by RFC-24.

RFC-24 did not make a formal requirement to use the proper insert methods as those and the object constructors
are the *only* way to add a layer, class or style to a map. I do not know if this is also true for symbols.


* "Because mapscript application often explicitly initialize "blank" layers,
  classes and styles directly, and then increment the count, we can't depend
  on all access going through the proper insert/add methods.  For this
  reason we preserve the old MS_MAX values to establish the initial allocation.
  This should mean that existing applications will continue to work at some
  cost in unused memory.  But well behaved mapscript applications using 
  insert methods to increase sizes will be able to grow beyond the initial 
  allocation."


I'm not aware of any mapscript way to bypass the insert or the constructors
(i.e. with direct manipulation of the arrays).
It there was such way (which I doubt) I suggest
that we forbid it by explicitly changing the MS_MAX_* names and making required fields immutable in swig.
