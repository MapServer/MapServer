Overview
--------

This RFC documents the changes required in order to upgrade MapServer's OGC
WMS support to version 1.3.0 of the specification.

MapServer already includes mechanisms to support multiple WMS versions (and
already supports WMS versions 1.0.0, 1.1.0 and 1.1.1) so in theory this 
upgrade should be straightforward and shouldn't require a RFC. 
Unfortunately, WMS 1.3.0 contains some tricky changes that while they are 
not exactly backwards incompatible are likely to make the life of users of
WMS miserable.

This RFC is mostly to document those changes and the way MapServer deals 
with them.

Technical Solution
------------------

The main issue introduced by WMS 1.3.0 is the change in the way it handles
axis order for several SRS. This has an impact on the way the
BBOX is specified in WMS requests and in Capabilities documents and in
how the CONNECTIONTYPE WMS code interacts with remote servers.

In previous versions of WMS, for any SRS the first axis
was the easting (x or lon) and the second axis was the northing (y or lat). 
Starting with WMS 1.3.0, some SRS such as the very popular
EPSG:4326 have their axis reversed and the axis order becomes lon, lat 
instead of lat, lon. This change in WMS 1.3.0 was done in order to align 
with the definitions from the EPSG database (a requirement to make WMS
an ISO specification).

This change is sure to confuse simple clients that used to treat all 
SRS the same way. MapServer and PROJ will need to be extended to carry
information about the axis order of all EPSG SRS codes and treat them
using the correct axis order.

New SRS codes in the CRS:xxxx space have also been added by WMS 1.3.0
that will need to be supported by MapServer

All the above need to be done in a way that allows continued support for
older versions of the WMS specification (1.0.0 to 1.1.1) and will have 
the least impact on existing WMS services.

At this point the exact implementation details have not all been sorted out.
They will be documented here as we refine them.


MapScript Implications
----------------------

None. This affects only the WMS server interface and WMS CONNECTION type.
