:Version: MapServer 5.2

Overview
--------

MapServer 5.0 supports "hard" text wrapping, where the wrap character is unconditionally treated as a newline. This rfc proposes the addition of:
 - conditional wrapping, i.e. newlines are only added when the current line length has met a user adjustable criteria
 - line alignment, i.e. text aligned per user request, namely right, center and left
 
These two additions are independant from one another, i.e. can be activated together or not.

Line Wrapping
------------------
A new keyword, for example MAXLEN is added to the label object, and interacts with the label WRAP parameter as follows:
 - the wrap character specifies what character can be replaced by a newline (no change w.r.t. the current meaning). Probably the most usefull wrap character will become ' ' (i.e. the space character)
- the MAXLEN value specifies the maximum number of characters that can compose a line before a newline is inserted. A value of 0 specifies the current "hard" wrapping. A positive value triggers wrapping at the WRAP character for lines longer than MAXLEN. A Negative value triggers wrapping than is allowed to break words, i.e. not necessarily at the WRAP character.

The WRAP / MAXLEN combinations are summarized here:

+----------------+-----------------+-----------------------------+-----------------+
|                |   maxlen =0     |     maxlen > 0              |    maxlen < 0   |
+================+=================+=============================+=================+
| wrap = 'char'  |  current way    | conditional wrap if current |                 |
|                |                 |  length > maxlen            |                 |
+----------------+-----------------+-----------------------------+     hard wrap   |
| no wrap        |  no processing  | skip label if  text is      |                 |
|                |                 |  longer than maxlen         |                 |
+----------------+-----------------+-----------------------------+-----------------+

Line Centering
----------------
A new keyword, for example ALIGN is added to the label object. It supports 3 values: left, center and right, 
and controls how text lines should be aligned w.r.t. the label bounding box. Precise placement of text can only
be done at the renderer level, by exactly defining the starting pixel of the current line. While this approach
could be taken, it would considerably burden the renderer code.

I propose to use a more generic though less precise way of doing, by padding the text lines with space characters
to approximate indentation. The initial implementation will only rely on the number of characters in each
text line:
 * loop through text lines to find the line with the most characters l_max
 * pad all the other lines with (l_max - l_cur)/2 space characters
 
A more advanced implementation could be to use the exact line lengths as returned by the renderers with the
msGetLabelSize function:
 * compute the size in pixels of the "  " string (two spaces, accounts for kerning): l_2space
 * loop through text lines to longest line of length pix_l_max
 * pad all the other lines with (pix_l_max - pix_l_cur)/2 * 1/(2*l_2space) space characters
 
Limitations: aligning text to the right will produce ugly results using this method, unless using a 
monospace font.  

Modifications to the source code
--------------------------------

* MAXLEN and ALIGN will be added to the LABEL object in map.h, in the mapfile parser/writer (mapfile.c) and in MapScript

* msTransformLabelText() in maplabel.c will be updated to support the modifications proposed. No other modifications
  should be required as the text itself is modified to fit the user's request (i.e. it is padded with spaces, and/or
  newlines are added to it)

MapScript Implications
----------------------

The labelObj will have a new maxlen property of type integer.
