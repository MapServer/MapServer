Proposed Changes
################

Scale Dependant Rendering
*************************

- All symbols can be scaled. When SYMBOLSCALEDENOM is given for a layer, the
  layer and all of its symbols (height, width, line widths, line patterns, line
  dashes, ...) are scaled. 

- CLASS->STYLE->SIZE gives the vertical dimension of the symbol's bounding box
  at the symbol scale (given by SYMBOLSCALEDENOM). For all other scales, the
  symbol is scaled proportionally to the mapscale.

- Symbol scaling can be limited by using CLASS->STYLE->MINSIZE and
  CLASS->STYLE->MAXSIZE. By using these MINSIZE/MAXSIZE, one can ensure that a
  symbol will never be rendered smaller/larger than the given sizes.

Precise Symbol Placement
************************

Harmonize the placement of symbols relative to the feature (point or line)
being drawn.

Fractional values for sizes
===========================
All symbols sizes and symbol geometries should be specified and
represented as double - AGG supports fractional line widths so users
should be able to set them explicitly. GD could either round or
truncate/cast the double to an int.

- STYLE->SIZE/MINSIZE/MAXSIZE - styleObj.size/minsize/maxsize
- STYLE->WIDTH/MINWIDTH/MAXWITH - styleObj.width/minwidth/maxwidth
- STYLE->GAP - style.gap (replaces symbol->gap)
- STYLE->PATTERN (new feature) - styleObj.pattern
- STYLE-> CENTER/ORIGIN (new feature) - styleObj.centerx/centery and originx/originy
- STYLE->OFFSET - styleObj.offsetx and styleObj.offsety
- LABEL->SIZE/MINSIZE/MAXSIZE - labelObj.size/minsize/maxsize
- LABEL->OFFSET - labelObj.offsetx and labelObj.offsety

CENTER/ORIGIN [x y]
===================
Defines the centre of the symbol using decimal pixels (x axis increasing to
the right, y axis increasing downwards).

- Is used for placing a point symbol on the map or on a "decorated" line
- Defines the center of rotation if an ANGLE is specified for point symbols.
- Default value is the centre of the symbol's bounding box.
- Applies to TYPE ellipse, vector, pixmap, truetype.

ANGLE [double|attribute] [DEFAULT|CLOCKWISE|COMPASS]
====================================================

- STYLE-> ANGLE [double|attribute] [DEFAULT|CLOCKWISE|COMPASS]
- LABEL-> ANGLE [double|auto|follow|attribute] [DEFAULT|CLOCKWISE|COMPASS]

To specify rotation, you need a point of rotation, a reference direction, a
direction of rotation and a unit of rotation.

Currently, angles for labels have a reference direction to the right (west),
and a counter-clockwise direction of rotation specified in degrees (0..360).

When specifying direction/rotation for symbols, compass direction is often used
(reference direction north and clockwise rotation). A mechanism to specify mode
of rotation/direction is needed.

The default would be reference direction east and counter-clockwise rotation.
If possible, something like:

Modes of operation
------------------
- DEFAULT reference direction to the right (east), counter-clockwise direction
  of rotation.
- CLOCKWISE reference direction to the right (east), clockwise direction of
  rotation.
- COMPASS reference direction to the north, clockwise direction of rotation
  (compass directions). 

Behavior
--------
- For symbols of Type HATCH, this is the angle of the hatched lines.
- For points, this specifies the rotation of a symbol around its defined
  CENTER.
- For point symbols on lines, this specifies the rotation of the symbol
  relative to the direction of the line (0 - the symbol's x-axis is oriented
  along the line), or a fixed compass direction for the symbols orientation
  (COMPASS).
- For polygon fills this specifies the rotation of the pattern given by its
  defining symbol. For its use with hatched lines, see Example#8 in the SYMBOL
  examples.

Keywords moved from SYMBOL to STYLE
***********************************

FIXME GAP [double]+ END
=======================
Gap between point symbols when rendered on a linear geometry (used eg. for
shields)
 
- Given in decimal pixels (at the symbol scale). Defines distances (centre to
  centre) between point symbols for line decoration at the layers symbol scale

- Default is 0.0. The first double gives the distance from the start of the
  line to the first point symbol, the rest of the doubles constitute a pattern
  of distances between the point symbols for the rest of the line.

- GAP distances are scaled. Applies to TYPEs vector, ellipse, pixmap, truetype

- FIXME : When drawing the symbol along a line segment, a negative GAP will add
  180 degrees to the angle.

- A GAP of 0 (the default value) will cause MapServer to use the symbol as a
  brush to draw the line. (AGG only)

- The defined centre (CENTER) of the symbol is used when placing the symbol on
  the line. When placing the symbol on the line, the symbol is oriented in such
  a way that the symbol's x-axis is directed along the line.


DASHPATTERN ([double on] [double off])+ END
===========================================
- renamed from STYLE
- the distances are scaled


more to come?
=============

New Functionnality
##################

add MINSCALEDENOM/MAXSCALEDENOM parameters to styleObj
******************************************************
this would allow doing things like removing outlines or the hollow portions of
"tube" line work based on scale.

add LABELMETHOD to layerObj
***************************
(or perhaps just method to labelObj?)
 
- this would allow users to choose label placement algorithms that meet their
  needs. For example, in D2 below improving label placement will come with a
  reduction in performance. In some situations simply using a shapes bounding
  box center is perfectly adequate.

- The default would be the improved placement in D2.

add LABEL to layersObj
*************************
so that a default can be defined for all classes (sort of like templates). A
class label would take precedent.

add OUTLINEWIDTH to styleObj
****************************
eg for drawing road lines with a cached outline
 
- It is currently impossible to have scale dependant road networks with a fixed
  width outline, this addition will remedy this.
 
- This would also be a shorthand to be able to specify an outline for linear
  networks, without having to specify two style blocks.


add TYPE to styleObj for line and polygon types 
***********************************************

modifies how the current shape is interpreted. Applies to line and polygon
layers (for now: any ideas for applying this to point layers?)
 
- TYPE BBOX : use the style to render the bounding box of the current shape

- TYPE CENTROID : render a single pointObj at the centroid of the feature

- TYPE VERTEXES : render a pointObj at each vertex of the shape.
  - how to specify angle (follows line direction, fixed, ....)
  - need to specify a way to ignore the start and/or end points of the feature

- TYPE START/END : render a pointObj at the start/end of the feature. would be
  used for example to add arrowheads to lines
  - default angle is direction of first/last segment
